      "forefathers; her black glossy hair, in heavy folds, hangs carelessly<br>\r\n",
      "about her olive shoulders, contrasting strangely with the other.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And you, Nicholas! remember what your father will say: but you must<br>\r\n",
      "not call him such,\" she says, taking by the hand a child we have<br>\r\n",
      "described, who is impatient to join the gay group.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"That ain't no harm, mother! Father always is fondling about me when<br>\r\n",
      "nobody's lookin',\" the child answers, with a pertness indicating a<br>\r\n",
      "knowledge of his parentage rather in advance of his years.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We pass to the kitchen,--a little, dingy cabin, presenting the most<br>\r\n",
      "indescribable portion of the scene, the smoke issuing from every<br>\r\n",
      "crevice. Here old Peggy, the cook,--an enveloped representative of<br>\r\n",
      "smoke and grease,--as if emerging from the regions of Vulcan, moves<br>\r\n",
      "her fat sides with the independence of a sovereign. In this<br>\r\n",
      "miniature smoke-pit she sweats and frets, runs to the door every few<br>\r\n",
      "minutes, adjusts the points of her flashy bandana, and takes a<br>\r\n",
      "wistful look at the movements without. Sal, Suke, Rose, and Beck,<br>\r\n",
      "young members of Peggy's family, are working at the top of their<br>\r\n",
      "energy among stew-pans, griddles, pots and pails, baskets, bottles<br>\r\n",
      "and jugs. Wafs, fritters, donjohns and hominy flap-jacks, fine<br>\r\n",
      "doused hams, savoury meats, ices, and fruit-cakes, are being<br>\r\n",
      "prepared and packed up for the occasion. Negro faces of every shade<br>\r\n",
      "seem full of interest and freshness, newly brightened for the<br>\r\n",
      "pleasures of the day. Now and then broke upon our ear that plaintive<br>\r\n",
      "melody with the words, \"Down on the Old Plantation;\" and again, \"Jim<br>\r\n",
      "crack corn, an' I don't care, for Mas'r's gone away.\" Then came Aunt<br>\r\n",
      "Rachel, always persisting in her right to be master of ceremonies,<br>\r\n",
      "dressed in her Sunday bombazine, puffed and flounced, her gingham<br>\r\n",
      "apron so clean, her head \"did up\" with the flashiest bandana in her<br>\r\n",
      "wardrobe; it's just the colour for her taste-real yellow, red, and<br>\r\n",
      "blue, tied with that knot which is the height of plantation toilet:<br>\r\n",
      "there is as little restraint in her familiarity with the gentry of<br>\r\n",
      "the mansion as there is in her control over the denizens of the<br>\r\n",
      "kitchen. Even Dandy and Enoch, dressed in their best black coats,<br>\r\n",
      "white pantaloons, ruffled shirts, with collars endangering their<br>\r\n",
      "ears, hair crisped with an extra nicety, stand aside at her bidding.<br>\r\n",
      "The height of her ambition is to direct the affairs of the mansion:<br>\r\n",
      "sometimes she extends it to the overseer. The trait is amiably<br>\r\n",
      "exercised: she is the best nigger on the plantation, and Marston<br>\r\n",
      "allows her to indulge her feelings, while his guests laugh at her<br>\r\n",
      "native pomposity, so generously carried out in all her commands. She<br>\r\n",
      "is preparing an elegant breakfast, which \"her friends\" must partake<br>\r\n",
      "of before starting. Everything must be in her nicest: she runs from<br>\r\n",
      "the ante-room to the hall, and from thence to the yard, gathering<br>\r\n",
      "plates and dishes; she hurries Old Peggy the cook, and again scolds<br>\r\n",
      "the waiters.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Daddy Bob and Harry have come into the yard to ask Marston's<br>\r\n",
      "permission to join the party as boatmen. They are in Aunt Rachel's<br>\r\n",
      "way, and she rushes past them, pushing them aside, and calling Mas'r<br>\r\n",
      "to come and attend to their wants. Marston comes forward, greets<br>\r\n",
      "them with a familiar shake of the hand, granting their request<br>\r\n",
      "without further ceremony. Breakfast is ready; but, anxious for the<br>\r\n",
      "amusement of the day, their appetites are despoiled. Franconia, more<br>\r\n",
      "lovely than ever, presenting that ease, elegance, and reserve of the<br>\r\n",
      "southern lady, makes her appearance in the hall, is escorted to the<br>\r\n",
      "table leaning on the arm of Maxwell. Delicacy, sensitiveness,<br>\r\n",
      "womanly character full of genial goodness, are traits with which the<br>\r\n",
      "true southern lady is blessed:--would she were blessed with another,<br>\r\n",
      "an energy to work for the good of the enslaved! Could she add that<br>\r\n",
      "to the poetry of her nature, how much greater would be her charm-how<br>\r\n",
      "much more fascinating that quiet current of thought with which she<br>\r\n",
      "seems blessed! There is a gentleness in her impulses--a pensiveness<br>\r\n",
      "in her smile--a softness in her emotions--a grace in her movements--an<br>\r\n",
      "ardent soul in her love! She is gay and lightsome in her youth; she<br>\r\n",
      "values her beauty, is capricious with her admirers, and yet becomes<br>\r\n",
      "the most affectionate mother; she can level her frowns, play with<br>\r\n",
      "the feelings, make her mercurial sympathy touching, knows the power<br>\r\n",
      "of her smiles: but once her feelings are enlisted, she is sincere<br>\r\n",
      "and ardent in her responses. If she cannot boast of the bright<br>\r\n",
      "carnatic cheek, she can swell the painter's ideal with her fine<br>\r\n",
      "features, her classic face, the glow of her impassioned eyes. But<br>\r\n",
      "she seldom carries this fresh picture into the ordinary years of<br>\r\n",
      "womanhood: the bloom enlivening her face is but transient; she loses<br>\r\n",
      "the freshness of girlhood, and in riper years, fades like a<br>\r\n",
      "sensitive flower, withering, unhappy with herself, unadmired by<br>\r\n",
      "others.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia sat at the table, a pensiveness pervading her countenance<br>\r\n",
      "that bespoke melancholy: as she glanced inquiringly round, her eyes<br>\r\n",
      "rested upon Lorenzo fixedly, as if she detected something in his<br>\r\n",
      "manner at variance with his natural deportment. She addressed him;<br>\r\n",
      "but his cold reply only excited her more: she resolved upon knowing<br>\r\n",
      "the cause ere they embarked. Breakfast was scarcely over before the<br>\r\n",
      "guests of the party from the neighbouring plantations began to<br>\r\n",
      "assemble in the veranda, leaving their servants in charge of the<br>\r\n",
      "viands grouped together upon the grass, under a clump of oaks a few<br>\r\n",
      "rods from the mansion. Soon the merry-makers, about forty in number,<br>\r\n",
      "old and young, their servants following, repaired to the landing,<br>\r\n",
      "where a long barge, surrounded by brakes and water-lilies, presented<br>\r\n",
      "another picture.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Him all straight, Mas'r-him all straight, jus so!\" said Daddy Bob,<br>\r\n",
      "as he strode off ahead, singing \"Dis is de way to de jim crack<br>\r\n",
      "corn.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Servants of all ages and colour, mammies and daddies, young 'uns and<br>\r\n",
      "prime fellows,--\"wenches\" that had just become hand-maids,--brought<br>\r\n",
      "up the train, dancing, singing, hopping, laughing, and sporting:<br>\r\n",
      "some discuss the looks of their young mistresses, others are<br>\r\n",
      "criticising their dress. Arrived at the landing, Daddy Bob and<br>\r\n",
      "Harry, full of cares, are hurrying several prime fellows, giving<br>\r\n",
      "orders to subordinate boatmen about getting the substantial on<br>\r\n",
      "board,--the baskets of champagne, the demijohns, the sparkling<br>\r\n",
      "nectar. The young beaux and belles, mingling with their dark sons<br>\r\n",
      "and daughters of servitude, present a motley group indeed-a scene<br>\r\n",
      "from which the different issues of southern life may be faithfully<br>\r\n",
      "drawn.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "A band of five musicians, engaged to enliven the sports of the day<br>\r\n",
      "with their music, announce, \"All on board!\" and give the signal for<br>\r\n",
      "starting by striking up \"Life on the Ocean Wave.\" Away they speed,<br>\r\n",
      "drawn by horses on the bank, amidst the waving of handkerchiefs, the<br>\r\n",
      "soft notes of the music reverberating over the pine-clad hills.<br>\r\n",
      "Smoothly and gently, onward they speed upon the still bosom of the<br>\r\n",
      "Ashly;-the deep, dark stream, its banks bedecked with blossoms and<br>\r\n",
      "richest verdure, is indeed enough to excite the romantic of one's<br>\r\n",
      "nature. Wild, yet serene with rural beauty, if ever sensations of<br>\r\n",
      "love steal upon us, it is while mingling in the simple<br>\r\n",
      "convivialities so expressive of southern life. On, on, the barge<br>\r\n",
      "moved, as lovers gathered together, the music dancing upon the<br>\r\n",
      "waters. Another party sing the waterman's merry song, still another<br>\r\n",
      "trail for lilies, and a third gather into the prow to test champagne<br>\r\n",
      "and ice, or regale with choice Havannas. Marston, and a few of the<br>\r\n",
      "older members, seated at midships, discuss the all-absorbing<br>\r\n",
      "question of State-rights; while the negroes are as merry as larks in<br>\r\n",
      "May, their deep jargon sounding high above the clarion notes of the<br>\r\n",
      "music. Now it subsides into stillness, broken only by the splashing<br>\r\n",
      "of an alligator, whose sports call forth a rapturous shout.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "After some three hours' sailing the barge nears a jut of rising<br>\r\n",
      "ground on the left bank. Close by it is a grove of noble old pines,<br>\r\n",
      "in the centre of which stands a dilapidated brick building, deserted<br>\r\n",
      "for some cause not set forth on the door: it is a pretty, shaded<br>\r\n",
      "retreat-a spot breathing of romance. To the right are broad lagoons<br>\r\n",
      "stretching far into the distance; their dark waters, beneath thick<br>\r\n",
      "cypress, presenting the appearance of an inundated grove. The<br>\r\n",
      "cypress-trees hang their tufted tops over the water's surface,<br>\r\n",
      "opening an area beneath studded with their trunks, like rude columns<br>\r\n",
      "supporting a panoply of foliage.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The barge stops, the party land; the shrill music, still dancing<br>\r\n",
      "through the thick forest, re-echoes in soft chimes as it steals<br>\r\n",
      "back upon the scene. Another minute, and we hear the voices of Daddy<br>\r\n",
      "Bob and Harry, Dandy and Enoch: they are exchanging merry laughs,<br>\r\n",
      "shouting in great good-nature, directing the smaller fry, who are<br>\r\n",
      "fagging away at the larder, sucking the ice, and pocketing the<br>\r\n",
      "lemons. \"Dat ain't just straight, nohow: got de tings ashore, an' ye<br>\r\n",
      "get 'e share whin de white folk done! Don' make 'e nigger ob<br>\r\n",
      "yourse'f, now, old Boss, doing the ting up so nice,\" Daddy says,<br>\r\n",
      "frowning on his minions. A vanguard have proceeded in advance to<br>\r\n",
      "take possession of the deserted house; while Aunt Rachel, with her<br>\r\n",
      "cort�ge of feminines, is fussing over \"young missus.\" Here, a group<br>\r\n",
      "are adjusting their sun-shades; there, another are preparing their<br>\r\n",
      "fans and nets. Then they follow the train, Clotilda and Ellen<br>\r\n",
      "leading their young representatives by the hand, bringing up the<br>\r\n",
      "rear among a cluster of smaller fry. Taking peaceable possession of<br>\r\n",
      "the house, they commence to clear the rooms, the back ones being<br>\r\n",
      "reserved for the sumptuous collation which Rachel and her juniors<br>\r\n",
      "are preparing. The musicians are mustered,--the young belles and<br>\r\n",
      "beaux, and not a few old bachelors, gather into the front room,<br>\r\n",
      "commence the f�tes with country dances, and conclude with the polka<br>\r\n",
      "and schottische.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Rachel's department presents a bustling picture; she is master of<br>\r\n",
      "ceremonies, making her sombre minions move at her bidding, adjusting<br>\r\n",
      "the various dishes upon the table. None, not even the most favoured<br>\r\n",
      "guests, dare intrude themselves into her apartments until she<br>\r\n",
      "announces the completion of her tables, her readiness to receive<br>\r\n",
      "friends. And yet, amidst all this interest of character, this happy<br>\r\n",
      "pleasantry, this seeming contentment, there is one group pauses ere<br>\r\n",
      "it arrives at the house,--dare not enter. The distinction seems<br>\r\n",
      "undefinable to us; but they, poor wretches, feel it deeply. Shame<br>\r\n",
      "rankles deep, to their very heart's core. They doubt their position,<br>\r\n",
      "hesitate at the door, and, after several nervous attempts to enter,<br>\r\n",
      "fall back,--gather round a pine-tree, where they enjoy the day,<br>\r\n",
      "separated from the rest. There is a simplicity-a forlornness, about<br>\r\n",
      "this little group, which attracts our attention, excites our<br>\r\n",
      "sympathies, unbends our curiosity: we would relieve the burden it<br>\r\n",
      "labours under. They are Ellen Juvarna, Clotilda, and their children.<br>\r\n",
      "Socially, they are disowned; they are not allowed to join the<br>\r\n",
      "festivities with those in the dance, and their feelings revolt at<br>\r\n",
      "being compelled to associate with the negroes. They are as white as<br>\r\n",
      "many of the whitest, have the same outlines of interest upon their<br>\r\n",
      "faces; but their lives are sealed with the black seal of slavery.<br>\r\n",
      "Sensible of the injustice that has stripped them of their rights,<br>\r\n",
      "they value their whiteness; the blood of birth tinges their face,<br>\r\n",
      "and through it they find themselves mere dregs of human<br>\r\n",
      "kind,--objects of sensualism in its vilest associations.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell has taken a deep interest in Clotilda; and the solicitude<br>\r\n",
      "she manifests for her child has drawn him still further in her<br>\r\n",
      "favour; he is determined to solve the mystery that shrouds her<br>\r\n",
      "history. Drawing near to them, he seats himself upon the ground at<br>\r\n",
      "their side, inquires why they did not come into the house. \"There's<br>\r\n",
      "no place there for us,--none for me,\" Clotilda modestly replies,<br>\r\n",
      "holding down her head, placing her arm around Annette's waist.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You would enjoy it much better, and there is no restraint upon<br>\r\n",
      "anyone.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We know not why the day was not for us to enjoy as well as others;<br>\r\n",
      "but it is ordained so. Where life is a dreary pain, pleasure is no<br>\r\n",
      "recompense for disgrace enforced upon us. They tell us we are not<br>\r\n",
      "what God made us to be; but it is the worst torture to be told so.<br>\r\n",
      "There is nothing in it-it is the curse only that remains to enforce<br>\r\n",
      "wrong. Those who have gifts to enjoy life, and those who move to<br>\r\n",
      "make others happy, can enjoy their separate pleasures; our lives are<br>\r\n",
      "between the two, hence there is little pleasure for us,\" she<br>\r\n",
      "answered, her eyes moistening with tears.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"If you will but come with me-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I will go anywhere,\" she rejoined, quickly; \"anywhere from<br>\r\n",
      "this; that I may know who I am-may bear my child with me-may lead a<br>\r\n",
      "virtuous life, instead of suffering the pangs of shame through a<br>\r\n",
      "life of unholy trouble.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"She never knows when she's well off. If Marston was to hear her<br>\r\n",
      "talk in that way, I wouldn't stand in her shoes,\" interrupted Ellen,<br>\r\n",
      "with a significant air.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Touched by this anxious reply, Maxwell determined to know more of<br>\r\n",
      "her feelings-to solve the anxiety that was hanging upon her mind,<br>\r\n",
      "and, if possible, to carry her beyond the power that held her and<br>\r\n",
      "her child in such an uncertain position.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I meant into the house,\" said he, observing that Ellen was not<br>\r\n",
      "inclined to favour Clotilda's feelings; and just at that moment the<br>\r\n",
      "shrill sounds of a bugle summoned the party to the collation. Here<br>\r\n",
      "another scene was enacted, which is beyond the power of pen to<br>\r\n",
      "describe. The tables, decorated with wild flowers, were spread with<br>\r\n",
      "meats of all descriptions,--fowl, game, pastry, and fruit, wines, and<br>\r\n",
      "cool drinks. Faces wearing the blandest smiles, grave matrons, and<br>\r\n",
      "cheerful planters,--all dressed in rustic style and neatness-gathered<br>\r\n",
      "around to partake of the feast, while servants were running hither<br>\r\n",
      "and thither to serve mas'r and missus with the choicest bits.<br>\r\n",
      "Toasts, compliments, and piquant squibs, follow the wine-cup. Then<br>\r\n",
      "came that picture of southern life which would be more worthy of<br>\r\n",
      "praise if it were carried out in the purity of motive:--as soon as<br>\r\n",
      "the party had finished, the older members, in their turn, set about<br>\r\n",
      "preparing a repast for the servants. This seemed to elate the<br>\r\n",
      "negroes, who sat down to their meal with great pomp, and were not<br>\r\n",
      "restrained in the free use of the choicest beverage. While this was<br>\r\n",
      "going on, Marston ordered Rachel to prepare fruit and pastry for<br>\r\n",
      "Ellen and Clotilda. \"See to them; and they must have wine too,\"<br>\r\n",
      "whispered Marston.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I know's dat, old Boss,\" returned Rachel, with a knowing wink.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "After the collation, the party divided into different sections. Some<br>\r\n",
      "enjoyed the dance, others strolled through the pine-grove,<br>\r\n",
      "whispering tales of love. Anglers repaired to the deep pond in quest<br>\r\n",
      "of trout, but more likely to find water-snakes and snapping turtles.<br>\r\n",
      "Far in the distance, on the right, moving like fairy gondolas<br>\r\n",
      "through the cypress-covered lagoon, little barks skim the dark<br>\r\n",
      "surface. They move like spectres, carrying their fair freight,<br>\r\n",
      "fanned by the gentle breeze pregnant with the magnolia' sweet<br>\r\n",
      "perfume. The fair ones in those tiny barks are fishing; they move<br>\r\n",
      "from tree to tree trailing their lines to tempt the finny tribe<br>\r\n",
      "here, and there breaking the surface with their gambols.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Lorenzo, as we have before informed the reader, exhibited signs of<br>\r\n",
      "melancholy during the day. So evident were they that Franconia's<br>\r\n",
      "sympathies became enlisted in his behalf, and even carried so far,<br>\r\n",
      "that Maxwell mistook her manner for indifference toward himself.<br>\r\n",
      "And, as if to confirm his apprehensions, no sooner had the collation<br>\r\n",
      "ended than she took Lorenzo's arm and retired to the remains of an<br>\r\n",
      "old mill, a few rods above the landing. It was a quiet, sequestered<br>\r\n",
      "spot-just such an one as would inspire the emotions of a sensitive<br>\r\n",
      "heart, recall the associations of childhood, and give life to our<br>\r\n",
      "pent-up enthusiasm. There they seated themselves, the one waiting<br>\r\n",
      "for the other to speak.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Tell me, Lorenzo,\" said Franconia, laying her hand on his arm, and<br>\r\n",
      "watching with nervous anxiety each change of his countenance, \"why<br>\r\n",
      "are you not joyous? you are gloomy to-day. I speak as a sister-you<br>\r\n",
      "are nervous, faltering with trouble-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Trouble!\" he interrupted, raising his eyes, and accompanying an<br>\r\n",
      "affected indifference with a sigh. It is something he hesitates to<br>\r\n",
      "disclose. He has erred! his heart speaks, it is high-handed crime!<br>\r\n",
      "He looks upon her affectionately, a forced smile spreads itself over<br>\r\n",
      "his face. How forcibly it tells its tale. \"Speak out,\" she<br>\r\n",
      "continues, tremulously: \"I am a sister; a sister cannot betray a<br>\r\n",
      "brother's secrets.\" She removes her hand and lays it gently upon his<br>\r\n",
      "shoulder.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Looking imploringly in her face for a few minutes, he replies as if<br>\r\n",
      "it were an effort of great magnitude. \"Something you must not<br>\r\n",
      "know-nor must the world! Many things are buried in the secrets of<br>\r\n",
      "time that would make great commotion if the world knew them. It were<br>\r\n",

      "through the forest, over the lawn; dying away in chimes that faintly<br>\r\n",

      "Anthony Romescos, a lean, wiry man, whose small indescribable face,<br>\r\n",
      "very much sun-scorched, is covered with bright sandy hair, matted<br>\r\n",

      "head, which, in consequence of the thinking it does, needs a deal of<br>\r\n",

      "bead-work; and, as if we had not become fully conscious of his<br>\r\n",
      "power, he draws aside his roundabout, and there, beneath the waist<br>\r\n",
      "of his pantaloons, is a girdle, to which a large hunting-knife is<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ah, Romescos,\" continued Graspum, \"you may play the fool; but you<br>\r\n",
      "must play it wisely to make it profitable. Here, position puts law<br>\r\n",
      "at defiance!-here it puts croakers over humanity to rest-here, when<br>\r\n",
      "it has money, it makes lawyers talk round the points, get fat among<br>\r\n",
      "themselves, fills the old judge's head with anything; so that he<br>\r\n",
      "laughs and thinks he don't know nothin'. Listen to what I'm goin' to<br>\r\n",
      "say, because you'll all make somethin' out on't. I've just got the<br>\r\n",
      "dignity to do all; and with the coin to back her up, can safe every<br>\r\n",
      "chance. When you fellers get into a snarl running off a white 'un,<br>\r\n",
      "or a free nigger, I has to bring out the big talk to make it seem<br>\r\n",
      "how you didn't understand the thing. 'Tain't the putting the big on,<br>\r\n",
      "but it's the keepin' on it on. You'd laugh to see how I does it;<br>\r\n",
      "it's the way I keeps you out of limbo, though.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We have said these men were Graspum's \"men;\" they are more-they are<br>\r\n",
      "a band of outlaws, who boast of living in a free country, where its<br>\r\n",
      "institutions may be turned into despotism. They carry on a system of<br>\r\n",
      "trade in human bodies; they stain the fairest spots of earth with<br>\r\n",
      "their crimes. They set law at defiance-they scoff at the depths of<br>\r\n",
      "hell that yawn for them,--the blackness of their villainy is known<br>\r\n",
      "only in heaven. Earth cares little for it; and those familiar with<br>\r\n",
      "the devices of dealers in human bodies shrink from the shame of<br>\r\n",
      "making them known to the world. There was a discontent in the party,<br>\r\n",
      "a clashing of interests, occasioned by the meagre manner in which<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum had divided the spoils of their degradation. He had set his<br>\r\n",
      "dignity and position in society at a much higher value than they<br>\r\n",
      "were willing to recognise,--especially when it was to share the<br>\r\n",
      "spoils in proportion. Dan Bengal, so called from his ferocity of<br>\r\n",
      "character, was a celebrated dog-trainer and negro-hunter, \"was great<br>\r\n",
      "in doing the savager portion of negro business.\" This, Romescos<br>\r\n",
      "contended, did not require so much cunning as his branch of the<br>\r\n",
      "business-which was to find \"loose places,\" where doubtful whites see<br>\r\n",
      "out remnants of the Indian race, and free negroes could be found<br>\r\n",
      "easy objects of prey; to lay plots, do the \"sharp,\" carry out plans<br>\r\n",
      "for running all free rubbish down south, where they would sell for<br>\r\n",
      "something.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True! it's all true as sunshine,\" says Romescos; \"we understand Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum inside and out. But ye ain't paid a dime to get me out of<br>\r\n",
      "any scrape. I was larned to nigger business afore I got into the<br>\r\n",
      "'tarnal thing; and when I just gits me eye on a nigger what nobody<br>\r\n",
      "don't own, I comes the sly over him-puts him through a course of<br>\r\n",

      "everybody's wonderin' where he can be gone to. I tell ye what, it<br>\r\n",
      "takes some stameny to keep the price of a prime feller in your<br>\r\n",
      "pocket, and wonder along with the rest where the rascal can be. If<br>\r\n",
      "you'd just see Bob Osmand doe it up, you'd think his face was made<br>\r\n",
      "for a methodist deacon in camp meeting-time. The way he comes it<br>\r\n",
      "when he wants to prove a free nigger's a runaway, would beat all the<br>\r\n",
      "disciples of Blackstone between here and old Kentuck. And then,<br>\r\n",
      "Bob's any sort of a gentleman, what you don't get in town every day,<br>\r\n",

      "compromise was settled upon,--'cos he can reason right into just<br>\r\n",
      "nothin' at all. Ye see it ain't the feelings that makes a feller a<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman in our business, it's knowing the human natur o' things;<br>\r\n",
      "how to be a statesman, when ye meets the like, how to be a<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman, and talk polite things, and sich like; how to be a jolly<br>\r\n",
      "fellow, an' put the tall sayings into the things of life; and when<br>\r\n",
      "ye gets among the lawyers, to know all about the pintes of the law,<br>\r\n",
      "and how to cut off the corners, so they'll think ye're bin a parish<br>\r\n",
      "judge. And then, when ye comes before the squire, just to talk<br>\r\n",
      "dignity to him-tell him where the law is what he don't seem to<br>\r\n",
      "comprehend. You've got to make a right good feller of the squire by<br>\r\n",
      "sticking a fee under his vest-pocket when he don't obsarve it. And<br>\r\n",
      "then, ye know, when ye make the squire a right good feller, you must<br>\r\n",
      "keep him to the point; and when there's any swarin' to be done, he's<br>\r\n",
      "just as easily satisfied as the law. It's all business, you see; and<br>\r\n",
      "thar's just the same kind a thing in it; because profit rules<br>\r\n",

      "down and drag out, and just tell a whole possee to come on, as I do.<br>\r\n",
      "And that's what ye don't seem to come at, Graspum,\" said Romescos,<br>\r\n",
      "again filling his glass, and drawing a long black pipe from his<br>\r\n",
      "pocket prepares it for a smoke.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, the trouble is, you all think you can carry out these matters<br>\r\n",
      "on your own hook; but it's no go, and you'll find it so. It's a<br>\r\n",
      "scheme that must have larger means at the head of it; and each man's<br>\r\n",
      "rights must be stipulated, and paid according to his own enterprise.<br>\r\n",
      "But this discontent is monstrous and injurious, and if continued<br>\r\n",
      "will prove unprofitable. You see, fellers, you've no responsibility,<br>\r\n",
      "and my position is your protection, and if you don't get rich you<br>\r\n",
      "must not charge the blame to me; and then just see how you live now<br>\r\n",
      "to what you did when ranging the piny woods and catching a stray<br>\r\n",
      "nigger here and there, what didn't hardly pay dog money. There's a<br>\r\n",
      "good deal in the sport of the thing, too; and ye know it amounts to<br>\r\n",
      "a good deal to do the gentleman and associate with big folks, who<br>\r\n",
      "puts the business into one's hands, by finding out who's got lean<br>\r\n",
      "purses and prime niggers,\" rejoined Graspum, very coolly.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ah, yes; that's the way ye comes it over these haristocrats, by<br>\r\n",
      "doin' the modest. Now, Graspum, 'tain't no trouble to leak a sap<br>\r\n",
      "like that Lorenzo, and make his friends stand the blunt after we've<br>\r\n",
      "roped him into your fixings,\" replied Romescos.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No, no; not a bit of it,\" resounded several voices. \"We do all the<br>\r\n",
      "dragwork with the niggers, and Graspum gets the tin.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"But he pays for the drink. Come, none of this bickering; we must<br>\r\n",
      "agree upon business, and do the thing up brown under the old<br>\r\n",
      "system,\" interrupted another.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Hold! close that bread trap o' yourn,\" Romescos shouts at the top<br>\r\n",
      "of his voice. \"You're only a green croaker from the piny woods,<br>\r\n",
      "where gophers crawl independent; you ain't seen life on the borders<br>\r\n",
      "of Texas. Fellers, I can whip any man in the crowd,--can maker the<br>\r\n",
      "best stump speech, can bring up the best logic; and can prove that<br>\r\n",
      "the best frightenin' man is the best man in the nigger business.<br>\r\n",
      "Now, if you wants a brief sketch of this child's history, ye can<br>\r\n",
      "have it.\" Here Romescos entered into an interesting account of<br>\r\n",
      "himself. He was the descendant of a good family, living in the city<br>\r\n",
      "of Charleston; his parents, when a youth, had encouraged his<br>\r\n",
      "propensities for bravery. Without protecting them with that medium<br>\r\n",
      "of education which assimilates courage with gentlemanly conduct,<br>\r\n",
      "carrying out the nobler impulses of our nature, they allowed him to<br>\r\n",
      "roam in that sphere which produces its ruffians. At the age of<br>\r\n",
      "fifteen he entered a counting-room, when his quick mercurial<br>\r\n",
      "temperament soon rendered him expert at its minor functions. Three<br>\r\n",
      "years had hardly elapsed when, in a moment of passion, he drew his<br>\r\n",
      "dirk, (a weapon he always carried) and, in making a plunge at his<br>\r\n",
      "antagonist, inflicted a wound in the breast of a near friend. The<br>\r\n",
      "wound was deep, and proved fatal. For this he was arraigned before a<br>\r\n",
      "jury, tried for his life. He proved the accident by an existing<br>\r\n",
      "friendship-he was honourably acquitted. His employer, after<br>\r\n",
      "reproaching him for his proceedings, again admitted him into his<br>\r\n",
      "employment. Such, however, was his inclination to display the<br>\r\n",
      "desperado, that before the expiration of another year he killed a<br>\r\n",
      "negro, shot two balls at one of his fellows, one of which was well<br>\r\n",
      "nigh proving fatal, and left the state. His recklessness, his<br>\r\n",
      "previous acts of malignity, his want of position, all left him<br>\r\n",
      "little hope of escaping the confines of a prison. Fleeing to parts<br>\r\n",
      "unknown, his absence relieved the neighbourhood of a responsibility.<br>\r\n",
      "For a time, he roamed among farmers and drovers in the mountains of<br>\r\n",
      "Tennessee; again he did menial labour, often forced to the direst<br>\r\n",
      "necessity to live. One day, when nearly famished, he met a<br>\r\n",
      "slave-driver, conducting his coffle towards the Mississippi, to whom<br>\r\n",
      "he proffered his services. The coarse driver readily accepted them;<br>\r\n",
      "they proceeded on together, and it was not long before they found<br>\r\n",
      "themselves fitting companions. The one was desperate-the other<br>\r\n",
      "traded in desperation. An ardent nature, full of courage and<br>\r\n",
      "adventure, was a valuable acquisition to the dealer, who found that<br>\r\n",
      "he had enlisted a youngster capable of relieving him of inflicting<br>\r\n",
      "that cruelty so necessary to his profession. With a passion for<br>\r\n",
      "inflicting torture, this youth could now gratify it upon those<br>\r\n",
      "unfortunate beings of merchandise who were being driven to the<br>\r\n",
      "shambles: he could gloat in the exercise of those natural<br>\r\n",
      "propensities which made the infliction of pain a pleasant<br>\r\n",
      "recreation. In the trade of human flesh all these cruel traits<br>\r\n",
      "became valuable; they enabled him to demand a good price for his<br>\r\n",
      "services. Initiated in all the mysteries of the trade, he was soon<br>\r\n",
      "entrusted with gangs of very considerable extent; then he made<br>\r\n",
      "purchases, laid plans to entrap free negroes, performed the various<br>\r\n",
      "intricacies of procuring affidavits with which to make slave<br>\r\n",
      "property out of free flesh. Nature was nature, and what was hard in<br>\r\n",
      "him soon became harder; he could crib \"doubtful white stuff\" that<br>\r\n",
      "was a nuisance among folks, and sell it for something he could put<br>\r\n",
      "in his pocket. In this way Romescos accumulated several hundred<br>\r\n",
      "dollars; but avarice increased, and with it his ferocity. It<br>\r\n",
      "belonged to the trade, a trade of wanton depravity. He became the<br>\r\n",
      "terror of those who assumed to look upon a negro's sufferings with<br>\r\n",
      "sympathy, scoffing at the finer feelings of mankind. Twice had his<br>\r\n",
      "rapacity been let loose-twice had it nearly brought him to the<br>\r\n",
      "gallows, or to the tribunal of Judge Lynch. And now, when completely<br>\r\n",
      "inured in the traffic of human flesh,--that traffic which transposes<br>\r\n",
      "man into a demon, his progress is checked for a while by a false<br>\r\n",
      "step.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "It was this; and this only to the deep disgrace of the freest and<br>\r\n",
      "happiest country on earth. A poor orphan girl, like many of her<br>\r\n",
      "class in our hospitable slave world, had been a mere cast-off upon<br>\r\n",
      "the community. She knew nothing of the world, was ignorant, could<br>\r\n",
      "neither read nor write,--something quite common in the south, but<br>\r\n",
      "seldom known in New England. Thus she became the associate of<br>\r\n",
      "depraved negroes, and again, served Romescos as a victim. Not<br>\r\n",
      "content with this, after becoming tired of her, he secured her in<br>\r\n",
      "the slave-pen of one of his fellow traders. Here he kept her for<br>\r\n",
      "several weeks, closely confined, feeding her with grits. Eventually<br>\r\n",
      "\"running\" her to Vicksburg, he found an accomplice to sign a bill of<br>\r\n",
      "sale, by which he sold her to a notorious planter, who carried her<br>\r\n",
      "into the interior. The wretched girl had qualities which the planter<br>\r\n",
      "saw might, with a little care, be made extremely valuable in the New<br>\r\n",
      "Orleans market,--one was natural beauty. She was not suitable<br>\r\n",
      "property for the agricultural department of either a cotton or sugar<br>\r\n",
      "plantation, nor was she \"the stripe\" to increase prime stock; hence<br>\r\n",
      "she must be prepared for the general market. When qualified<br>\r\n",
      "according to what the planter knew would suit the fancy market, she<br>\r\n",
      "was conveyed to New Orleans, a piece of property bright as the very<br>\r\n",
      "brightest, very handsome, not very intelligent,--just suited to the<br>\r\n",
      "wants of bidders.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Here, at the shambles in the crescent city, she remained guarded,<br>\r\n",
      "and for several weeks was not allowed to go beyond the door-sill;<br>\r\n",
      "after which a sale was effected of her with the keeper of a brothel,<br>\r\n",
      "for the good price of thirteen hundred dollars. In this sink of<br>\r\n",
      "iniquity she remained nearly two years. Fearing the ulterior<br>\r\n",
      "consequences, she dared not assert her rights to freedom, she dared<br>\r\n",
      "not say she was born free in a free country. Her disappearance from<br>\r\n",
      "the village in which she had been reared caused some excitement; but<br>\r\n",
      "it soon reduced itself to a very trifling affair. Indeed, white<br>\r\n",
      "trash like this was considered little else than rubbish, not worth<br>\r\n",
      "bringing up respectably. And while suspicion pointed to Romescos, as<br>\r\n",
      "the person who could account for her mysterious disappearance, such<br>\r\n",
      "was the fear of his revenge that no one dared be the accuser.<br>\r\n",
      "Quietly matters rested, poor virtue was mean merchandise, had its<br>\r\n",
      "value, could be bought and sold-could be turned to various uses,<br>\r\n",
      "except enlisting the sympathies of those who study it as a market<br>\r\n",
      "commodity. A few days passed and all was hushed; no one enquired<br>\r\n",
      "about the poor orphan, Martha Johnson. In the hands of her creole<br>\r\n",
      "owner, who held her as a price for licentious purposes, she<br>\r\n",
      "associated with gentlemen of polite manners-of wealth and position.<br>\r\n",
      "Even this, though profane, had advantages, which she employed for<br>\r\n",
      "the best of purposes; she learned to read and to write,--to<br>\r\n",
      "assimilate her feelings with those of a higher class. Society had<br>\r\n",
      "degraded her, she had not degraded herself. One night, as the<br>\r\n",
      "promiscuous company gathered into the drawing-room, she recognised a<br>\r\n",
      "young man from her native village; the familiar face inspired her<br>\r\n",
      "with joy, her heart leaped with gladness; he had befriended her poor<br>\r\n",
      "mother-she knew he had kind feelings, and would be her friend once<br>\r\n",
      "her story was told. The moments passed painfully; she watched him<br>\r\n",
      "restlessly through the dance,--sat at his side. Still he did not<br>\r\n",
      "recognise her,--toilet had changed her for another being; but she had<br>\r\n",
      "courted self-respect rather than yielded to degradation. Again she<br>\r\n",
      "made signs to attract his attention; she passed and repassed him,<br>\r\n",
      "and failed. Have I thus changed, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "At length she succeeded in attracting his attention; she drew him<br>\r\n",
      "aside, then to her chamber. In it she disclosed her touching<br>\r\n",
      "narrative, unfolded her sorrows, appealed to him with tears in her<br>\r\n",
      "eyes to procure her freedom and restore her to her rights. Her story<br>\r\n",
      "enlisted the better feelings of a man, while her self-respect, the<br>\r\n",
      "earnestness with which she pleaded her deliverance, and the<br>\r\n",
      "heartlessness of the act, strongly rebuked the levity of those who<br>\r\n",
      "had made her an orphan outcast in her own village. She was then in<br>\r\n",
      "the theatre of vice, surrounded by its allurements, consigned to its<br>\r\n",
      "degradation, a prey to libertinism-yet respecting herself. The<br>\r\n",
      "object of his visit among the denizens was changed to a higher<br>\r\n",
      "mission, a duty which he owed to his moral life,--to his own<br>\r\n",
      "manliness. He promised his mediation to better her eventful and<br>\r\n",
      "mysterious life, to be a friend to her; and nobly did he keep his<br>\r\n",
      "promise. On the following day he took measures for her rescue, and<br>\r\n",
      "though several attempts were made to wrest her from him, and the<br>\r\n",
      "mendacity of slave-dealers summoned to effect it, he had the<br>\r\n",
      "satisfaction of seeing her restored to her native village,--to<br>\r\n",
      "freedom, to respectability.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We withhold the details of this too true transaction, lest we should<br>\r\n",
      "be classed among those who are endeavouring to create undue<br>\r\n",
      "excitement. The orphan girl we here refer to was married to a<br>\r\n",
      "respectable mechanic, who afterwards removed to Cincinnati, and with<br>\r\n",
      "his wife became much respected citizens.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Proceedings were after some delay commenced against Romescos,<br>\r\n",
      "but,--we trust it was not through collusion with officials-he escaped<br>\r\n",
      "the merited punishment that would have been inflicted upon him by a<br>\r\n",
      "New England tribunal. Again he left the state, and during his<br>\r\n",
      "absence it is supposed he was engaged in nefarious practices with<br>\r\n",
      "the notorious Murrel, who carried rapine and death into the<br>\r\n",
      "unoffending villages of the far west. However, be this as it may,<br>\r\n",

      "which her Texan provinces struggled for independence. Freebooters,<br>\r\n",
      "they espoused the Texan cause because it offered food for their<br>\r\n",
      "rapacity, and through it they became formidable and desperate foes<br>\r\n",
      "to the enemy. They were the terror of the ranchoes, the inhabitants<br>\r\n",
      "fled at their approach; their pillage, rapine, and slaughtering,<br>\r\n",
      "would stain the annals of barbarous Africa. They are buried, let us<br>\r\n",

      "In their incursions, as mounted riflemen, they besieged villages,<br>\r\n",
      "slaughtered the inhabitants, plundered churches, and burned<br>\r\n",
      "dwellings; they carried off captive females, drove herds of cattle<br>\r\n",
      "to distant markets. Through the auspices of this band, as is now<br>\r\n",
      "well known, many young females were carried off and sold into<br>\r\n",
      "slavery, where they and their offspring yet remain. While pursuing<br>\r\n",
      "this nefarious course of life, Romescos accumulated more than twenty<br>\r\n",
      "thousand dollars; and yet,--though ferocity increased with the<br>\r\n",
      "daring of his profession,--there was one impulse of his nature,<br>\r\n",
      "deeply buried, directing his ambition. Amid the dangers of war, the<br>\r\n",
      "tumult of conflict, the passion for daring-this impulse kept alive<br>\r\n",
      "the associations of home,--it was love! In early life he had formed<br>\r\n",
      "an attachment for a beautiful young lady of his native town; it had<br>\r\n",
      "ripened with his years; the thoughts of her, and the hope of<br>\r\n",
      "regaining her love if he gained wealth, so worked upon his mind that<br>\r\n",
      "he resolved to abandon the life of a guerillo, and return home.<br>\r\n",
      "After an absence of fourteen years he found the object of his early<br>\r\n",
      "love,--that woman who had refused to requite his affection,--a widow,<br>\r\n",
      "having buried her husband, a gentleman of position, some months<br>\r\n",
      "previous.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos had money,--the man was not considered; he is not considered<br>\r\n",
      "where slavery spreads its vices to corrupt social life. He had been<br>\r\n",
      "careful to keep his business a profound secret, and pressing his<br>\r\n",
      "affections, soon found the object of his ambition keenly sensitive<br>\r\n",
      "to his advances. Rumour recounted his character with mystery and<br>\r\n",
      "suspicion; friends remonstrated, but in vain; they were united<br>\r\n",
      "despite all opposition, all appeals. For a time he seemed a better<br>\r\n",
      "man, the business he had followed harassed his mind, seeming to<br>\r\n",
      "haunt him, and poison his progress. He purchased a plantation on the<br>\r\n",
      "banks of the Santee; for once resolved to pursue an honest course,<br>\r\n",
      "to be a respectable citizen, and enjoy the quiet of home.<br>\r\n",

      "A year passed: he might have enjoyed the felicity of domestic life,<br>\r\n",

      "for his restless spirit. He was not made to enjoy the quiet of life,<br>\r\n",
      "the task stood before him like a mountain without a pass, he could<br>\r\n",
      "not wean himself from the vices of a marauder. He had abused the<br>\r\n",
      "free offerings of a free country, had set law at defiance; he had<br>\r\n",
      "dealt in human flesh, and the task of resistance was more than the<br>\r\n",
      "moral element in his nature could effect. Violations of human laws<br>\r\n",
      "were mere speculations to him; they had beguiled him, body and soul.<br>\r\n",
      "He had no apology for violating personal feeling; what cared he for<br>\r\n",
      "that small consideration, when the bodies of men, women, and<br>\r\n",
      "children could be sacrificed for that gold which would give him<br>\r\n",
      "position among the men of the south. If he carried off poor whites,<br>\r\n",
      "and sold them into slavery, he saw no enormity in the performance;<br>\r\n",
      "the law invested him with power he made absolute. Society was<br>\r\n",
      "chargeable with all his wrongs, with all his crimes, all his<br>\r\n",
      "enormities. He had repeatedly told it so, pointing for proof to that<br>\r\n",
      "literal observance of the rule by which man is made mere<br>\r\n",
      "merchandise. Society had continued in its pedantic folly,<br>\r\n",

      "party with his power and intrepidity, and enable him to set a higher<br>\r\n",
      "value upon his services,--he lighted a pipe, threw his hat upon the<br>\r\n",
      "floor, commenced pacing up and down the room, as if labouring under<br>\r\n",
      "deep excitement. And while each one seemed watching him intently, a<br>\r\n",

      "blood-hounds, the yelps of curs, mingling with the murmurs of those<br>\r\n",

      "\"I is'nt so bad a feller a'ter all-is I?\" he says, rushing forward<br>\r\n",
      "into the centre of the room, followed by four huge hounds. They were<br>\r\n",
      "noble animals, had more instinctive gentleness than their masters,<br>\r\n",
      "displayed a knowledge of the importance of the prize they had just<br>\r\n",
      "gained.<br>\r\n",

      "\"Hurrah for Nath! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah, for Nath! You got him,<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos, however, remained silent, pacing the floor unconcerned,<br>\r\n",

      "exultation, held forth, by the crispy hair, the blanched and bloody<br>\r\n",
      "head of an unfortunate negro who had paid the penalty of the State's<br>\r\n",
      "allowance for outlaws. \"There: beat that, who can? Four hundred<br>\r\n",

      "smiles upon it as his offering, then throws it into the fire place,<br>\r\n",
      "carelessly, like a piece of fuel. The dogs spring upon it, as if the<br>\r\n",
      "trophy was for their feast; but he repulses them; dogs are not so<br>\r\n",
      "bad after all-the canine is often the better of the two-the morsel<br>\r\n",
      "is too precious for canine dogs,--human dogs must devour it. \"There<br>\r\n",

      "health of his friends. He imagines himself the best fellow of the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Surrounded by all these dark forebodings, Marston begins to reflect<br>\r\n",

      "when repentance is pure; but his life is full of moral blemishes; he<br>\r\n",
      "has sinned against the innocent, against the God of forgiveness. The<br>\r\n",
      "inert of his nature is unfolding itself,--he has lived according to<br>\r\n",
      "the tolerated vices of society-he has done no more than the law gave<br>\r\n",
      "him a right to do! And yet, that very society, overlooking its own<br>\r\n",
      "wrongs, would now strip him of its associations. He lives in a State<br>\r\n",
      "where it is difficult to tell what society will approve or<br>\r\n",
      "reprobate; where a rich man may do with impunity what would consign<br>\r\n",
      "a poor man to the gallows.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "If we examine the many rencontres that take place in the south,<br>\r\n",
      "especially those proving fatal, we will find that the perpetrator,<br>\r\n",
      "if he be a rich man, invariably receives an \"honourable acquittal.\"<br>\r\n",
      "Again, when the man of position shoots down his victim in the<br>\r\n",
      "streets of a city, he is esteemed brave; but a singular reversion<br>\r\n",
      "takes place if the rencontre be between poor men. It is then a<br>\r\n",
      "diabolical act, a murder, which nothing short of the gallows can<br>\r\n",
      "serve for punishment. The creatures whom he had made mere objects to<br>\r\n",
      "serve his sensuality were before him; he traced the gloomy history<br>\r\n",
      "of their unfortunate sires; he knew that Ellen and Clotilda were<br>\r\n",
      "born free. The cordon that had bound his feelings to the system of<br>\r\n",
      "slavery relaxed. For the first time, he saw that which he could not<br>\r\n",
      "recognise in his better nature-himself the medium of keeping human<br>\r\n",
      "beings in slavery who were the rightful heirs of freedom. The<br>\r\n",
      "blackness of the crime-its cruelty, its injustice-haunted him; they<br>\r\n",
      "were at that very moment held by Graspum's caprice. He might doom<br>\r\n",
      "the poor wretches to irretrievable slavery, to torture and death!<br>\r\n",
      "Then his mind wandered to Annette and Nicholas; he saw them of his<br>\r\n",
      "own flesh and blood; his natural affections bounded forth; how could<br>\r\n",
      "he disown them? The creations of love and right were upon him,<br>\r\n",
      "misfortune had unbound his sensations; his own offspring stood<br>\r\n",
      "before him clothed in trouble thick and dangerous. His follies have<br>\r\n",
      "entailed a life-rent of misery upon others; the fathomless depth of<br>\r\n",
      "the future opens its yawning jaws to swallow up those upon whom the<br>\r\n",

      "has associated with him from childhood, assimilated with his<br>\r\n",

      "simple nature of the negro has just disclosed; it lies deeply rooted<br>\r\n",
      "at the foundation of all the wrongs of slavery. Education would be<br>\r\n",

      "Clasping her arms round her child, again she wept in silence. The<br>\r\n",
      "moment was propitious--the summer sun had just set beneath dark<br>\r\n",
      "foliage in the west, its refulgent curtains now fading into mellow<br>\r\n",
      "tints; night was closing rapidly over the scene, the serene moon<br>\r\n",
      "shone softly through the arbour into the little window at her<br>\r\n",
      "bedside. Again she took him by the hand, invited him to sit down at<br>\r\n",
      "her side, and, looking imploringly in his face, continued,--\"If you<br>\r\n",
      "are a friend, you can be a friend in confidence, in purpose. I am a<br>\r\n",
      "slave! yes, a slave; there is much in the word, more than most men<br>\r\n",
      "are disposed to analyse. It may seem simple to you, but follow it to<br>\r\n",
      "its degraded depths-follow it to where it sows the seeds of sorrow,<br>\r\n",
      "and there you will find it spreading poison and death, uprooting all<br>\r\n",
      "that is good in nature. Worse than that, my child is a slave too. It<br>\r\n",
      "is that which makes the wrong more cruel, that mantles the polished<br>\r\n",
      "vice, that holds us in that fearful grasp by which we dare not seek<br>\r\n",
      "our rights.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My mother, ah! yes, my mother\"-Clotilda shakes her head in sorrow.<br>\r\n",
      "\"How strange that, by her misfortune, all, all, is misfortune for<br>\r\n",
      "ever! from one generation to another, sinking each life down, down,<br>\r\n",
      "down, into misery and woe. How oft she clasped my hand and whispered<br>\r\n",
      "in my ear: 'If we could but have our rights.' And she, my mother,--as<br>\r\n",
      "by that sacred name I called her-was fair; fairer than those who<br>\r\n",
      "held her for a hideous purpose, made her existence loathsome to<br>\r\n",
      "herself, who knew the right but forced the wrong. She once had<br>\r\n",
      "rights, but was stripped of them; and once in slavery who can ask<br>\r\n",
      "that right be done?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"What rights have you beyond these?\" he interrupted, suddenly.<br>\r\n",
      "\"There is mystery in what you have said, in what I have seen;<br>\r\n",
      "something I want to solve. The same ardent devotion, tenderness,<br>\r\n",
      "affection,--the same touching chasteness, that characterises<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia, assimilates in you. You are a slave, a menial-she is<br>\r\n",
      "courted and caressed by persons of rank and station. Heavens! here<br>\r\n",
      "is the curse confounding the flesh and blood of those in high<br>\r\n",
      "places, making slaves of their own kinsmen, crushing out the spirit<br>\r\n",
      "of life, rearing up those broken flowers whose heads droop with<br>\r\n",
      "shame. And you want your freedom?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"For my child first,\" she replied, quickly: \"I rest my hopes of her<br>\r\n",
      "in the future.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell hesitated for a moment, as if contemplating some plan for<br>\r\n",
      "her escape, ran his fingers through his hair again and again, then<br>\r\n",
      "rested his forehead in his hand, as the perspiration stood in heavy<br>\r\n",
      "drops upon it. \"My child!\" There was something inexpressibly<br>\r\n",
      "touching in the words of a mother ready to sacrifice her own<br>\r\n",
      "happiness for the freedom of her child. And yet an awful<br>\r\n",
      "responsibility hung over him; should he attempt to gain their<br>\r\n",
      "freedom, and fail in carrying out the project, notwithstanding he<br>\r\n",
      "was in a free country, the act might cost him his life. But there<br>\r\n",
      "was the mother, her pride beaming forth in every action, a wounded<br>\r\n",
      "spirit stung with the knowledge of being a slave, the remorse of her<br>\r\n",
      "suffering soul-the vicissitudes of that sin thus forced upon her.<br>\r\n",
      "The temptation became irresistible.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You are English!\"-northerners and Englishmen know what liberty is.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Negroes at the South have a very high opinion of Northern cleverness<br>\r\n",
      "in devising means of procuring their liberty. The Author here uses<br>\r\n",
      "the language employed by a slave girl who frequently implored aid to<br>\r\n",
      "devise some plan by which she would be enabled to make her escape.<br>\r\n",
      "Northerners could do great things for us, if they would but know us<br>\r\n",
      "as we are, study our feelings, cast aside selfish motives, and<br>\r\n",
      "sustain our rights!\" Clotilda now commenced giving Maxwell a history<br>\r\n",
      "of her mother,--which, however, we must reserve for another chapter.<br>\r\n",
      "\"And my mother gave me this!\" she said, drawing from her pocket a<br>\r\n",
      "paper written over in Greek characters, but so defaced as to be<br>\r\n",
      "almost unintelligible. \"Some day you will find a friend who will<br>\r\n",
      "secure your freedom through that,\" she would say. \"But freedom-that<br>\r\n",
      "which is such a boon to us-is so much feared by others that you must<br>\r\n",
      "mark that friend cautiously, know him well, and be sure he will not<br>\r\n",
      "betray the liberty you attempt to gain.\" And she handed him the<br>\r\n",
      "defaced paper, telling him to put it in his pocket.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And where is your mother?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There would be a store of balm in that, if I did but know. Her<br>\r\n",
      "beauty doomed her to a creature life, which, when she had worn out,<br>\r\n",
      "she was sold, as I may be, God knows how soon. Though far away from<br>\r\n",
      "me, she is my mother still, in all that recollection can make her;<br>\r\n",
      "her countenance seems like a wreath decorating our past<br>\r\n",
      "associations. Shrink not when I tell it, for few shrink at such<br>\r\n",
      "things now,--I saw her chained; I didn't think much of it then, for I<br>\r\n",
      "was too young. And she took me in her arms and kissed me, the tears<br>\r\n",
      "rolled down her cheeks; and she said-'Clotilda, Clotilda, farewell!<br>\r\n",
      "There is a world beyond this, a God who knows our hearts, who<br>\r\n",
      "records our sorrows;' and her image impressed me with feelings I<br>\r\n",
      "cannot banish. To look back upon it seems like a rough pilgrimage;<br>\r\n",
      "and then when I think of seeing her again my mind gets lost in<br>\r\n",
      "hopeless expectations\"--<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You saw her chained?\" interrupted Maxwell.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, even chained with strong irons. It need not surprise you.<br>\r\n",
      "Slavery is a crime; and they chain the innocent lest the wrong<br>\r\n",
      "should break forth upon themselves.\" And she raised her hands to her<br>\r\n",
      "face, shook her head, and laid Annette in the little bed at the foot<br>\r\n",
      "of her own.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "What is it that in chaining a woman, whether she be black as ebony<br>\r\n",
      "or white as snow, degrades all the traits of the southerner's<br>\r\n",
      "character, which he would have the world think noble? It is fear!<br>\r\n",
      "The monster which the southerner sees by day, tolerates in his<br>\r\n",
      "silence, protects as part and parcel of a legal trade, only clothes<br>\r\n",
      "him with the disgrace that menials who make themselves mere fiends<br>\r\n",
      "are guilty of, Maxwell thought to himself.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I will set you free, if it cost my life!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Hush, hush!\" rejoined Clotilda: \"remember those wretches on the<br>\r\n",
      "plantation. They, through their ignorance, have learned to wield the<br>\r\n",
      "tyranny of petty power; they look upon us with suspicious eyes. They<br>\r\n",
      "know we are negroes (white negroes, who are despicable in their<br>\r\n",
      "eyes), and feeling that we are more favoured, their envy is excited.<br>\r\n",
      "They, with the hope of gaining favour, are first to disclose a<br>\r\n",
      "secret. Save my child first, and then save me\"--<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I will save you first; rest assured, I will save you;\" he<br>\r\n",
      "responded, shaking her hand, bidding her good night. On returning to<br>\r\n",
      "the mansion he found Marston seated at the table in the<br>\r\n",
      "drawing-room, in a meditative mood. Good night, my friend!\" he<br>\r\n",
      "accosted him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ah, good night!\" was the sudden response.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You seem cast down?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No!-all's not as it seems with a man in trouble. How misfortune<br>\r\n",
      "quickens our sense of right! O! how it unfolds political and moral<br>\r\n",
      "wrongs! how it purges the understanding, and turns the good of our<br>\r\n",
      "natures to thoughts of justice. But when the power to correct is<br>\r\n",
      "beyond our reach we feel the wrong most painfully,\" Marston coldly<br>\r\n",
      "replied.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"It never is too late to do good; my word for it, friend Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "good is always worth its services. I am young and may serve you yet;<br>\r\n",
      "rise above trouble, never let trifles trouble a man like you. The<br>\r\n",
      "world seems wagging pleasantly for you; everybody on the plantation<br>\r\n",
      "is happy; Lorenzo has gone into the world to distinguish himself;<br>\r\n",
      "grief should never lay its scalpel in your feelings. Remember the<br>\r\n",
      "motto-peace, pleasantry, and plenty; they are things which should<br>\r\n",
      "always dispel the foreshadowing of unhappiness,\" says Maxwell,<br>\r\n",
      "jocularly, taking a chair at Marston's request, and seating himself<br>\r\n",
      "by the table.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Marston declares such consolation to be refreshing, but too easily<br>\r\n",
      "conceived to effect his purpose. The ripest fruits of vice often<br>\r\n",
      "produce the best moral reflections: he feels convinced of this<br>\r\n",
      "truth; but here the consequences are entailed upon others. The<br>\r\n",
      "degradation is sunk too deep for recovery by him,--his reflections<br>\r\n",
      "are only a burden to him. The principle that moves him to atone is<br>\r\n",
      "crushed by the very perplexity of the law that compels him to do<br>\r\n",
      "wrong. \"There's what goads me,\" he says: \"it is the system, the<br>\r\n",
      "forced condition making one man merchandise, and giving another<br>\r\n",
      "power to continue him as such.\" He arises from the table, his face<br>\r\n",
      "flushed with excitement, and in silence paces the room to and fro<br>\r\n",
      "for several minutes. Every now and then he watches at the<br>\r\n",
      "window,--looks out towards the river, and again at the pine-woods<br>\r\n",
      "forming a belt in the background, as if he expected some one from<br>\r\n",
      "that direction. The serene scene without, calm and beautiful,<br>\r\n",
      "contrasting with the perplexity that surrounded him within,<br>\r\n",
      "brought the reality of the change which must soon take place in his<br>\r\n",
      "affairs more vividly to his mind.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Your feelings have been stimulated and modified by education; they<br>\r\n",
      "are keenly sensitive to right,--to justice between man and man. Those<br>\r\n",
      "are the beautiful results of early instruction. New England<br>\r\n",
      "education! It founds a principle for doing good; it needs no<br>\r\n",
      "contingencies to rouse it to action. You can view slavery with the<br>\r\n",
      "unprejudiced eye of a philosopher. Listen to what I am about to say:<br>\r\n",
      "but a few months have passed since I thought myself a man of<br>\r\n",
      "affluence, and now nothing but the inroads of penury are upon me.<br>\r\n",
      "The cholera (that scourge of a southern plantation) is again<br>\r\n",
      "sweeping the district: I cannot expect to escape it, and I am in the<br>\r\n",
      "hands of a greater scourge than the cholera,--a slow death-broker. He<br>\r\n",
      "will take from you that which the cholera would not deign to touch:<br>\r\n",
      "he has no more conscience than a cotton-press,\" says Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "reclining back in his chair, and calling the negro waiter.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The word conscience fell upon Maxwell's ear with strange effect. He<br>\r\n",
      "had esteemed Marston according to his habits-not a good test when<br>\r\n",
      "society is so remiss of its duties: he could not reconcile the touch<br>\r\n",
      "of conscience in such a person, nor could he realise the impulse<br>\r\n",
      "through which some sudden event was working a moral regeneration in<br>\r\n",
      "his mind. There was something he struggled to keep from notice. The<br>\r\n",
      "season had been unpropitious, bad crops had resulted; the cholera<br>\r\n",
      "made its appearance, swept off many of the best negroes, spread<br>\r\n",
      "consternation, nearly suspended discipline and labour. One by one<br>\r\n",
      "his negroes fell victims to its ravages, until it became<br>\r\n",
      "imperatively necessary to remove the remainder to the pine-woods.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Families might be seen here and there making their little<br>\r\n",
      "preparations to leave for the hills: the direful scourge to them was<br>\r\n",
      "an evil spirit, sent as a visitation upon their bad deeds. This they<br>\r\n",
      "sincerely believe, coupling it with all the superstition their<br>\r\n",
      "ignorance gives rise to. A few miles from the mansion, among the<br>\r\n",
      "pines, rude camps are spread out, fires burn to absorb the malaria,<br>\r\n",
      "to war against mosquitoes, to cook the evening meal; while, up<br>\r\n",
      "lonely paths, ragged and forlorn-looking negroes are quietly<br>\r\n",
      "wending their way to take possession. The stranger might view this<br>\r\n",
      "forest bivouac as a picture of humble life pleasantly domiciled; but<br>\r\n",
      "it is one of those unfortunate scenes, fruitful of evil, which beset<br>\r\n",
      "the planter when he is least able to contend against them. Such<br>\r\n",
      "events develope the sin of an unrighteous institution, bring its<br>\r\n",
      "supporters to the portals of poverty, consign harmless hundreds to<br>\r\n",
      "the slave-marts.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "In this instance, however, we must give Marston credit for all that<br>\r\n",
      "was good in his intentions, and separate him from the system.<br>\r\n",
      "Repentance, however produced, is valuable for its example, and if<br>\r\n",
      "too late for present utility, seldom fails to have an ultimate<br>\r\n",
      "influence. Thus it was with Marston; and now that all these<br>\r\n",
      "inevitable disasters were upon him, he resolved to be a father to<br>\r\n",
      "Annette and Nicholas,--those unfortunates whom law and custom had<br>\r\n",
      "hitherto compelled him to disown.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Drawing his chair close to Maxwell, he lighted a cigar, and resumed<br>\r\n",
      "the disclosure his feelings had apparently interrupted a few minutes<br>\r\n",
      "before. \"Now, my good friend, all these things are upon me; there is<br>\r\n",
      "no escaping the issue. My people will soon be separated from me; my<br>\r\n",
      "old, faithful servants, Bob and Harry, will regret me, and if they<br>\r\n",
      "fall into the hands of a knave, will die thinking of the old<br>\r\n",
      "plantation. As for Harry, I have made him a preacher,--his knowledge<br>\r\n",
      "is wonderfully up on Scripture; he has demonstrated to me that<br>\r\n",
      "niggers are more than mortal, or transitory things. My conscience<br>\r\n",
      "was touched while listening to one of his sermons; and then, to<br>\r\n",
      "think how I had leased him to preach upon a neighbouring plantation,<br>\r\n",
      "just as a man would an ox to do a day's work! Planters paid me so<br>\r\n",
      "much per sermon, as if the gospel were merchandise, and he a mere<br>\r\n",
      "thing falsifying all my arguments against his knowledge of the Word<br>\r\n",
      "of God. Well, it makes me feel as if I were half buried in my own<br>\r\n",
      "degradation and blindness. And then, again, they are our property,<br>\r\n",
      "and are bestowed upon us by a legal-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"If that be wrong,\" interrupted Maxwell, \"you have no excuse for<br>\r\n",
      "continuing it.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True! That's just what I was coming at. The evil in its broadest<br>\r\n",
      "expanse is there. We look calmly on the external objects of the<br>\r\n",
      "system without solving its internal grievances,--we build a right<br>\r\n",
      "upon the ruins of ancient wrongs, and we swathe our thoughts with<br>\r\n",
      "inconsistency that we may make the curse of a system invulnerable.<br>\r\n",
      "It is not that we cannot do good under a bad system, but that we<br>\r\n",
      "cannot ameliorate it, lest we weaken the foundation. And yet all<br>\r\n",
      "this seems as nothing when I recall a sin of greater magnitude-a sin<br>\r\n",
      "that is upon me-a hideous blot, goading my very soul, rising up<br>\r\n",
      "against me like a mountain, over which I can see no pass. Again the<br>\r\n",
      "impelling force of conscience incites me to make a desperate effort;<br>\r\n",
      "but conscience rebukes me for not preparing the way in time. I could<br>\r\n",
      "translate my feelings further, but, in doing so, the remedy seems<br>\r\n",
      "still further from me-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Is it ever too late to try a remedy-to make an effort to surmount<br>\r\n",
      "great impediments-to render justice to those who have suffered from<br>\r\n",
      "such acts?\" inquired Maxwell, interrupting Marston as he proceeded.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"If I could do it without sacrificing my honour, without exposing<br>\r\n",
      "myself to the vengeance of the law. We are great sticklers for<br>\r\n",
      "constitutional law, while we care little for constitutional justice.<br>\r\n",
      "There is Clotilda; you see her, but you don't know her history: if<br>\r\n",
      "it were told it would resound through the broad expanse of our land.<br>\r\n",
      "Yes, it would disclose a wrong, perpetrated under the smiles of<br>\r\n",
      "liberty, against which the vengeance of high Heaven would be<br>\r\n",
      "invoked. I know the secret, and yet I dare not disclose it; the<br>\r\n",
      "curse handed down from her forefathers has been perpetuated by me.<br>\r\n",
      "She seems happy, and yet she is unhappy; the secret recesses of her<br>\r\n",
      "soul are poisoned. And what more natural? for, by some unlucky<br>\r\n",
      "incident, she has got an inkling of the foul means by which she was<br>\r\n",
      "made a slave. To him who knows the right, the wrong is most painful;<br>\r\n",
      "but I bought her of him whose trade it was to sell such flesh and<br>\r\n",
      "blood! And yet that does not relieve me from the curse: there's the<br>\r\n",
      "stain; it hangs upon me, it involves my inclinations, it gloats over<br>\r\n",
      "my downfall-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You bought her!\" again interrupts Maxwell.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True,\" rejoins the other, quickly, \"'tis a trade well protected by<br>\r\n",
      "our democracy. Once bought, we cannot relieve ourselves by giving<br>\r\n",
      "them rights in conflict with the claims of creditors. Our will may<br>\r\n",
      "be good, but the will without the means falls hopeless. My heart<br>\r\n",
      "breaks under the knowledge that those children are mine. It is a sad<br>\r\n",
      "revelation to make,--sad in the eyes of heaven and earth. My<br>\r\n",
      "participation in wrong has proved sorrow to them: how can I look to<br>\r\n",
      "the pains and struggles they must endure in life, when stung with<br>\r\n",
      "the knowledge that I am the cause of it? I shall wither under the<br>\r\n",
      "torture of my own conscience. And there is even an interest about<br>\r\n",
      "them that makes my feelings bound joyfully when I recur them. Can it<br>\r\n",
      "be aught but the fruit of natural affection? I think not; and yet I<br>\r\n",
      "am compelled to disown them, and even to smother with falsehood the<br>\r\n",
      "rancour that might find a place in Franconia's bosom. Clotilda loves<br>\r\n",
      "Annette with a mother's fondness; but with all her fondness for her<br>\r\n",
      "child she dare not love me, nor I the child.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell suggests that his not having bought the child would<br>\r\n",
      "certainly give him the right to control his own flesh and blood: but<br>\r\n",
      "he knows little of slave law, and less of its customs. He, however,<br>\r\n",
      "was anxious to draw from Marston full particulars of the secret that<br>\r\n",
      "would disclose Clotilda's history, over which the partial exposition<br>\r\n",
      "had thrown the charm of mystery. Several times he was on the eve of<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"One Silenus; a trader who trades in this quality of property only,<br>\r\n",
      "and has become rich by the traffic. He is associated with Anthony<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos, once a desperado on the Texan frontier. These two coveys<br>\r\n",
      "would sell their mossmates without a scruple, and think it no harm<br>\r\n",
      "so long as they turned a dime. They know every justice of the peace<br>\r\n",
      "from Texas to Fort M'Henry. Romescos is turned the desperado again,<br>\r\n",
      "shoots, kills, and otherwise commits fell deeds upon his neighbour's<br>\r\n",
      "negroes; he even threatens them with death when they approach him<br>\r\n",
      "for reparation. He snaps his fingers at law, lawyers, and judges:<br>\r\n",
      "slave law is moonshine to those who have no rights in common law-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And he escapes? Then you institute laws, and substitute custom to<br>\r\n",
      "make them null. It is a poor apology for a namesake. But do you<br>\r\n",
      "assert that in the freest and happiest country-a country that boasts<br>\r\n",
      "the observance of its statute laws-a man is privileged to shoot,<br>\r\n",
      "maim, and torture a fellow-being, and that public opinion fails to<br>\r\n",
      "bring him to justice?\" ejaculated Maxwell.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" returns Marston, seriously; \"it is no less shameful than<br>\r\n",
      "true. Three of my negroes has he killed very good-naturedly, and yet<br>\r\n",
      "I have no proof to convict him. Even were I to seek redress, it<br>\r\n",
      "would be against that prejudice which makes the rights of the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The trouble exists in making the man merchandise, reducing him to an<br>\r\n",
      "abject being, without the protection of common law. Presently the<br>\r\n",
      "tears began to flow down Marston's cheeks, as he unbuttoned his<br>\r\n",
      "shirt-collar with an air of restlessness, approached a desk that<br>\r\n",
      "stood in one corner of the room, and drew from it a somewhat defaced<br>\r\n",
      "bill of sale. There was something connected with that bit of paper,<br>\r\n",
      "which, apart from anything else, seemed to harass him most. \"But a<br>\r\n",
      "minute before you entered I looked upon that paper,\" he spoke,<br>\r\n",
      "throwing it upon the table, \"and thought how much trouble it had<br>\r\n",
      "brought me, how through it I had left a curse upon innocent life. I<br>\r\n",
      "paid fifteen hundred dollars for the souls and bodies of those two<br>\r\n",

      "in the right way, to seek its retribution on the wrong!\" Thus<br>\r\n",
      "concluding, Marston covers his face in his hands, and for several<br>\r\n",
      "minutes weeps like a child. Again rising from his seat, he throws<br>\r\n",
      "the paper on a table near an open window, and himself upon a couch<br>\r\n",
      "near by.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell attempts to quiet him by drawing his attention from the<br>\r\n",
      "subject. There is little use, however,--it is a terrible<br>\r\n",
      "conflict,--the conflict of conscience awakening to a sense of its<br>\r\n",
      "errors; the fate of regrets when it is too late to make amends.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "While this was going on, a brawny hand reached into the window, and<br>\r\n",
      "quickly withdrew the paper from the table. Neither observed it.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "And at the moment, Marston ejaculated, \"I will! I will! let it cost<br>\r\n",
      "what it may. I will do justice to Clotilda and her child,--to Ellen<br>\r\n",
      "and her child; I will free them, send them into a free country to be<br>\r\n",
      "educated.\" In his excitement he forgot the bill of sale.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Like enough you will!\" responds a gruff voice; and a loud rap at<br>\r\n",
      "the hall-door followed. Dandy was summoned, opened the door, bowed<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos into the room. He pretends to be under the influence of<br>\r\n",
      "liquor, which he hopes will excuse his extraordinary familiarity at<br>\r\n",
      "such a late hour. Touching the hilt of his knife, he swaggers into<br>\r\n",
      "the presence of Marston, looks at him fixedly, impertinently demands<br>\r\n",
      "something to drink. He cares not what it be, waits for no ceremony,<br>\r\n",
      "tips the decanter, gulps his glass, and deliberately takes a seat.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The reader will perhaps detect the object of his presence; but,<br>\r\n",
      "beyond that, there is something deep and desperate in the appearance<br>\r\n",
      "of the man, rendering his familiarity exceedingly disagreeable. That<br>\r\n",
      "he should present himself at such an untimely hour was strange,<br>\r\n",
      "beyond Marston's comprehension. It was, indeed, most inopportune;<br>\r\n",
      "but knowing him, he feared him. He could not treat him with<br>\r\n",
      "indifference,--there was his connection with Graspum, his power over<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "WHILE the proceedings we have detailed in the foregoing chapter were<br>\r\n",
      "progressing at Graspum's slave-pen, a different phase of the system<br>\r\n",
      "was being discussed by several persons who had assembled at the<br>\r\n",
      "house of Deacon Rosebrook. Rumour had been busy spreading its<br>\r\n",
      "many-sided tales about Marston-his difficulties, his connection with<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum, his sudden downfall. All agreed that Marston was a<br>\r\n",
      "noble-minded fellow, generous to a fault-generous in his worst<br>\r\n",
      "errors; and, like many other southerners, who meant well, though<br>\r\n",
      "personally kind to his slaves, never set a good example in his own<br>\r\n",
      "person. Religion was indispensably necessary to preserve submission;<br>\r\n",
      "and, with a view to that end, he had made the Church a means of<br>\r\n",
      "producing it.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Now, if the southerner resorted to the Church in the purity of<br>\r\n",
      "Christian motives, he would merit that praise which many are so<br>\r\n",
      "willing to bestow. Or, if Christianity were embraced by the<br>\r\n",
      "southerner with heartfelt purity and faith, it would undoubtedly<br>\r\n",
      "have a beneficial influence, elevate the character of the slave,<br>\r\n",
      "promote kindly feelings between him and his master, and ultimately<br>\r\n",
      "prove profitable to both. But where Christianity, used by<br>\r\n",
      "irreligious persons, whose very acts destroy the vitality of the<br>\r\n",
      "means, is made the medium of enforcing superstition, and of debasing<br>\r\n",
      "the mind of the person it degrades into submission, its application<br>\r\n",
      "becomes nothing less than criminal. It is criminal because it brings<br>\r\n",
      "true religion into contempt, perverts Christianity-makes it a<br>\r\n",
      "mockery, and gives to the degraded whites of the South a plea for<br>\r\n",
      "discarding its precepts. Religion-were it not used as a mechanical<br>\r\n",
      "agency-would elevate the degraded white population of the South;<br>\r\n",
      "they would, through its influence, become valuable citizens.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "These remarks have been forced upon us by observation. Frequently<br>\r\n",
      "have we lamented its application, and grieved that its holy mission<br>\r\n",
      "were made to serve the vilest purposes in a land of liberty, of<br>\r\n",
      "Christian love. Religion a means of degrading the masses-a<br>\r\n",
      "subservient agent! It is so, nevertheless; and men use it whose only<br>\r\n",
      "desire it is to make it serve a property interest-the interest of<br>\r\n",
      "making men, women, and children, more valuable in the market. God<br>\r\n",
      "ordained it for a higher purpose,--man applies it for his benefit in<br>\r\n",
      "the man-market. Hence, where the means for exercising the mind upon<br>\r\n",
      "the right is forbidden-where ignorance becomes the necessary part of<br>\r\n",
      "the maintenance of a system, and religion is applied to that end, it<br>\r\n",
      "becomes farcical; and while it must combine all the imperfections of<br>\r\n",
      "the performer, necessarily tends to confine the ignorance of those<br>\r\n",
      "it seeks to degrade, within the narrowest boundary. There are<br>\r\n",
      "different ways of destroying the rights of different classes; and as<br>\r\n",
      "many different ways, after they are destroyed, of wiping out the<br>\r\n",
      "knowledge of their ever having had rights. But, we regret to say,<br>\r\n",
      "that most resorted to by the South, in the face of civilisation, is<br>\r\n",
      "the Holy Scriptures, which are made the medium of blotting out all<br>\r\n",
      "knowledge of the rights a people once possessed. The wrong-doer thus<br>\r\n",
      "fears the result of natural laws; if they be allowed to produce<br>\r\n",
      "results through the cultivation of a slave's mind, such may prove<br>\r\n",
      "fatal to his immediate interests. And to maintain a system which is<br>\r\n",
      "based on force, the southern minister of the gospel is doubly<br>\r\n",
      "culpable in the sight of heaven; for while he stimulates ignorance<br>\r\n",
      "by degrading the man, he mystifies the Word of God, that he may<br>\r\n",
      "remain for ever and ever degraded.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "What a deplorable process of stealing-nay, gently taking away the<br>\r\n",
      "knowledge which an all-wise Providence has given to man as his<br>\r\n",
      "inheritance; how it reduces his natural immunities to sensual<br>\r\n",
      "misery! And, too, it forbids all legitimate influences that could<br>\r\n",
      "possibly give the menial a link to elevation, to the formation of a<br>\r\n",
      "society of his own. We would fain shrink from such a system of<br>\r\n",
      "debasing mankind-even more, from the hideous crimes of those who<br>\r\n",
      "would make Scripture the means to such an end. And yet, the Church<br>\r\n",
      "defender of slavery-the Christian little one-his neck-cloth as white<br>\r\n",
      "as the crimes he defends are black-must distinguish his arguments;<br>\r\n",
      "and that the world may not suspect his devotion, his honesty, his<br>\r\n",
      "serious intention, he points us to the many blessings of the<br>\r\n",
      "plantation-service.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Heavenly divinity! Let us have faith in the little ones sent to<br>\r\n",
      "teach it; they tell us slavery enforces Christianity! The management<br>\r\n",
      "of ignorance under the direction of ministers of the gospel is<br>\r\n",
      "certainly becoming well-defined; while statesmen more energetically<br>\r\n",
      "legalise it. The one devises, the other carries out a law to make<br>\r\n",
      "man ignorant of everything but labour. But while the statesman<br>\r\n",
      "moulds the theory, the preacher manufactures Scripture texts, that<br>\r\n",
      "the menial may believe God has ordained him the pliable victim.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Under the apparent necessity of the slave world, Marston had<br>\r\n",
      "regularly paid Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy for preaching to his<br>\r\n",
      "property on Sundays; and to the requisite end the good Elder felt<br>\r\n",
      "himself in duty bound to inculcate humility in all things that would<br>\r\n",
      "promote obedience to a master's will. Of course, one sermon was<br>\r\n",
      "quite sufficient; and this the credulous property had listened to<br>\r\n",
      "for more than three years. The effect was entirely satisfactory, the<br>\r\n",
      "result being that the honest property were really impressed with a<br>\r\n",
      "belief, that to evince Christian fortitude under suffering and<br>\r\n",
      "punishment was the best means of cleansing themselves of the sins<br>\r\n",
      "they were born to. This formality was misnamed Christianity--it was!<br>\r\n",
      "And through the force of this one sermon the Elder became indolent;<br>\r\n",
      "and indolence led him to its natural yoke-fellow-intemperance. His<br>\r\n",
      "indulgent mood, such as we have described him enjoying in a previous<br>\r\n",
      "chapter, became too frequent, leading to serious annoyances. They<br>\r\n",
      "had been especially serious for Marston, whom they placed in an<br>\r\n",
      "awkward situation before his property, and he resolved to tolerate<br>\r\n",
      "them no longer. Probably this resolution was hastened by the sudden<br>\r\n",
      "discovery of Harry's singular knowledge of Scripture; be that as it<br>\r\n",
      "may, the only difficulty in the way was to know if Harry could be so<br>\r\n",
      "trained, that he would preach the \"right stripe\" doctrine. This,<br>\r\n",
      "however, was soon settled, and Marston not only suspended his<br>\r\n",
      "engagement with the Elder, but entered into a contract with the<br>\r\n",
      "neighbouring planters, by the terms of which Harry will fill their<br>\r\n",
      "pulpit, and preach extempore--the Elder has brought written sermons<br>\r\n",
      "into contempt with Harry--at a stipulated price per Sunday. In this<br>\r\n",
      "new avocation-this leap from the plantation to the pulpit, Harry, as<br>\r\n",
      "a piece of property, became extremely valuable; while, through the<br>\r\n",
      "charm of his new black coat, he rose a great man in the estimation<br>\r\n",
      "of the common property. Here was a valuable incentive of submission,<br>\r\n",
      "a lesson for all bad niggers, a chance for them to improve under the<br>\r\n",
      "peculiar institution. It proved to niggerdom what a good nigger<br>\r\n",
      "could be if he only fear God and obey his master in all things.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Here was proof that a nigger could be something more than a nigger,<br>\r\n",
      "in spite of southern philosophy. The Elder-good, pious man that he<br>\r\n",
      "was-found himself out of pocket and out of preaching. Thrown upon<br>\r\n",
      "the resources of his ingenuity, he had, in order to save the<br>\r\n",
      "dictates of his conscience, while taking advantage of the many<br>\r\n",
      "opportunities of making money afforded by the peculiar institution,<br>\r\n",
      "entered upon another branch of business, having for its object the<br>\r\n",
      "advancement of humanity. He resolved to go forth purchasing the sick<br>\r\n",
      "and the dying; to reclaim sinking humanity and make it marketable.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "But, before describing the vicissitudes through which Elder<br>\r\n",
      "Pemberton Praiseworthy passes in his new mission of humanity, we<br>\r\n",
      "must introduce the reader to the precincts of a neat little villa,<br>\r\n",
      "situated at the outskirts of the city of C--. It is a small cottage<br>\r\n",
      "surrounded with verandas and trellis-work, over which are creeping<br>\r\n",
      "numerous woodbines and multafloras, spreading their fragrant<br>\r\n",
      "blossoms, giving it an air of sequestered beauty. An arbour of<br>\r\n",
      "grapevines extends from a little portico at the front to a wicker<br>\r\n",
      "fence that separates the embankment of a well-arranged garden, in<br>\r\n",
      "which are pots of rare plants, beds and walks decorated with<br>\r\n",
      "flowers, presenting great care and taste. A few paces in the rear of<br>\r\n",
      "the cottage are several \"negro cabins\" nicely white-washed without,<br>\r\n",
      "and an air of cheerfulness and comfort reigning within. The house-<br>\r\n",
      "servants are trimly dressed; they look and act as if their thoughts<br>\r\n",
      "and affections were with \"mas'r and missus.\" Their white aprons and<br>\r\n",
      "clean bright frocks-some bombazine, and some gingham-give them an<br>\r\n",
      "appearance of exactness, which, whether it be voluntary or force of<br>\r\n",
      "discipline, bears evidence of attention in the slave, and<br>\r\n",
      "encouragement on the part of the master. This is the Villa of Deacon<br>\r\n",
      "Rosebrook; they call him deacon, by courtesy; in the same sense that<br>\r\n",
      "Georgia majors and South Carolina generals are honoured with those<br>\r\n",
      "far-famed titles which so distinguish them when abroad. Perhaps we<br>\r\n",
      "should be doing the deacon no more than justice if we were to admit<br>\r\n",
      "that he had preached in very respectable spheres; but, feeling that<br>\r\n",
      "he was wanting in the purity of divine love-that he could not do<br>\r\n",
      "justice to his conscience while setting forth teachings he did not<br>\r\n",
      "follow, he laid the profession aside for the more genial<br>\r\n",
      "associations of plantation life. Indeed, he was what many called a<br>\r\n",
      "very easy backslider; and at times was recognised by the somewhat<br>\r\n",
      "singular soubriquet of Deacon Pious-proof. But he was kind to his<br>\r\n",
      "slaves, and had projected a system singularly at variance with that<br>\r\n",
      "of his neighbours-a system of mildness, amelioration, freedom.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "His plantation, a small one, some few miles from the Villa,<br>\r\n",
      "presented the same neatness and comfort, the same cheerfulness among<br>\r\n",
      "the negroes, and the same kindly feeling between master and slave,<br>\r\n",
      "which characterised the Villa.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We enter a neatly-furnished parlour, where the deacon and a friend<br>\r\n",
      "are seated on a sofa; various pictures are suspended from the<br>\r\n",
      "wall,--everything betokens New England neatness. The old-fashioned<br>\r\n",
      "dog-irons and fender are polished to exquisite brightness, a<br>\r\n",
      "Brussels carpet spreads the floor, a bright surbase encircles the<br>\r\n",
      "room; upon the flossy hearth-rug lies crouched the little canine<br>\r\n",
      "pet, which Aunt Dolly has washed to snowy whiteness. Aunt Dolly<br>\r\n",
      "enters the room with a low curtsy, gently raises the poodle, then<br>\r\n",
      "lays him down as carefully as if he were an heir to the estate.<br>\r\n",
      "Master is happy, \"missus\" is happy, and Aunt Dolly is happy; and the<br>\r\n",
      "large bookcase, filled with well-selected volumes, adds to the air<br>\r\n",
      "of contentment everywhere apparent. In a niche stands a large<br>\r\n",
      "pier-table, upon which are sundry volumes with gilt edges, nets of<br>\r\n",
      "cross-work, porcelain ornaments, and card-cases inlaid with mosaic.<br>\r\n",
      "Antique tables with massive carved feet, in imitation of lions'<br>\r\n",
      "paws, chairs of curious patterns, reclines and ottomans of softest<br>\r\n",
      "material, and covered with satin damask, are arranged round the room<br>\r\n",
      "in harmony and good taste.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Scranton,\" the deacon says to his friend, who is a tall,<br>\r\n",
      "prim, sedate-looking man, apparently about forty, \"I pity Marston; I<br>\r\n",
      "pity him because he is a noble-hearted fellow. But, after all, this<br>\r\n",
      "whispering about the city may be only mother Rumour distributing her<br>\r\n",
      "false tales. Let us hope it is all rumour and scandal. Come, tell<br>\r\n",
      "me-what do you think of our negroes?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Nigger character has not changed a bit in my mind, since I came<br>\r\n",
      "south. Inferior race of mortals, sir!-without principles, and fit<br>\r\n",
      "only for service and submission. A southern man knows their<br>\r\n",
      "composition, but it takes a northern to study the philosophy-it<br>\r\n",
      "does,\" replies Mr. Scranton, running his left hand over his<br>\r\n",
      "forehead, and then his right over the crown of his head, as if to<br>\r\n",
      "cover a bald spot with the scanty remnant of hair that projected<br>\r\n",
      "from the sides.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The deacon smiles at the quaint reply. He knows Mr. Scranton's<br>\r\n",
      "northern tenacity, and begs to differ with him. \"You are ultra, a<br>\r\n",
      "little ultra, in all things, Mr. Scranton. I fear it is that,<br>\r\n",
      "carried out in morals as well as politics, that is fast reducing our<br>\r\n",
      "system to degradation and tyranny. You northern gentlemen have a<br>\r\n",
      "sort of pedantic solicitude for our rights, but you underrate our<br>\r\n",
      "feelings upon the slavery question. I'm one among the few<br>\r\n",
      "southerners who hold what are considered strange views: we are<br>\r\n",
      "subjected to ridicule for our views; but it is only by those who see<br>\r\n",
      "nothing but servitude in the negro,--nothing but dollars and cents in<br>\r\n",
      "the institution of slavery.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton is struck with astonishment, interrupts the argument by<br>\r\n",
      "insisting upon the great superiority of the gentlemen whites, and<br>\r\n",
      "the Bible philosophy which he can bring to sustain his argument.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Stop one moment, my philosophic friend,\" the deacon interposes,<br>\r\n",
      "earnestly. \"Upon that you northerners who come out here to sustain<br>\r\n",
      "the cause of slavery for the south, all make fools of yourselves.<br>\r\n",
      "This continual reasoning upon Bible philosophy has lost its life,<br>\r\n",
      "funeral dirges have been played over it, the instruments are worn<br>\r\n",
      "out. And yet, the subject of the philosophy lives,--he belies it with<br>\r\n",
      "his physical vigour and moral action. We doubt the sincerity of<br>\r\n",
      "northerners; we have reasons for so doing; they know little of the<br>\r\n",
      "negro, and care less. Instead of assisting southerners who are<br>\r\n",
      "inclined to do justice to the wretch-to be his friend-to improve his<br>\r\n",
      "condition-to protect him against a tyrant's wrong, you bring us into<br>\r\n",
      "contempt by your proclaiming virtue over the vice we acknowledge<br>\r\n",
      "belongs to the institution. We know its defects-we fear them; but,<br>\r\n",
      "in the name of heaven, do not defend them at the cost of virtue,<br>\r\n",
      "truth, honesty. Do not debase us by proclaiming its glories over our<br>\r\n",
      "heads;-do not take advantage of us by attempting to make wrong<br>\r\n",
      "right.\" The deacon's feelings have become earnest; his face glows<br>\r\n",
      "with animation.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton seems discomfited. \"That's just like all you<br>\r\n",

      "the good of our love, if you always doubt it?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Such love!\" says the deacon, with a sarcastic curl on his lip.<br>\r\n",
      "\"It's cotton-bag love, as full of self as a pressed bale-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"But, deacon; you're getting up on the question.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton inquires very seriously-wishing it particularly to be<br>\r\n",

      "considers all northerners white-washed, ready to deceive through the<br>\r\n",
      "dim shadows of self. The deacon's frank and manly opinion of<br>\r\n",
      "northern editors and preachers disturbs Scranton's serious<br>\r\n",
      "philosophy. \"Cotton-bag love!\" there's something in it, and contempt<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I do! He who maketh right, what those most interested in know to be<br>\r\n",

      "that become doubtful in their ultraness, the weakness carries the<br>\r\n",
      "insincerity,--the effort becomes stagnant. Never sell yourself to any<br>\r\n",
      "class of evils for popularity's sake. If you attempt it you mistake<br>\r\n",
      "the end, and sell yourself to the obscurity of a political<br>\r\n",

      "into a declamatory attitude. \"You southerners don't understand what<br>\r\n",

      "you know how slow you are to do things, and to let your property all<br>\r\n",
      "go to waste while you might make a good speculation on it. There's<br>\r\n",
      "just the difference of things: we study political economy so as to<br>\r\n",
      "apply it to trade and such like; you let things go to waste, just<br>\r\n",
      "thinking over it. And, you see, it's our nature to be restless and<br>\r\n",
      "searching out the best avenues for developing trade. Why, deacon,<br>\r\n",
      "your political philosophy would die out if the New Englander didn't<br>\r\n",

      "must encourage the mechanic, and give tone to his pursuits; and,<br>\r\n",
      "more than all, we must arrest the spread of conventional nonsense,<br>\r\n",

      "labour, and removing the odium which attaches itself to those who<br>\r\n",
      "pursue such avocations as the slave may be engaged in. My word for<br>\r\n",
      "it, Mr. Scranton, there's where the trouble lies. Nature has been<br>\r\n",
      "lavish in her good gifts to the south; but we must lend Nature a<br>\r\n",

      "good; and we must break down those social barriers clogging our<br>\r\n",

      "her handfellow in regeneration; but good government must give Nature<br>\r\n",
      "her rights. This done, slavery will cease to spread its loathsome<br>\r\n",

      "persons to arrange a table so neatly; my boys did it all, you see!\"<br>\r\n",
      "And she exults over the efficiency of her negroes, who stand at her<br>\r\n",
      "side acknowledging the compliment with broad grins. The deacon helps<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton, who commences stowing away the sweetmeats with great<br>\r\n",
      "gusto. \"It is truly surprising what charming nigger property you<br>\r\n",
      "have got. They don't seem a bit like niggers\" he concludes<br>\r\n",
      "deliberately taking a mouthful. Mrs. Rosebrook, pleased at the<br>\r\n",
      "honest remark, reminds him that the deacon carries out her views<br>\r\n",
      "most charmingly, that she studies negro character, and knows that by<br>\r\n",
      "stimulating it with little things she promotes good. She studies<br>\r\n",
      "character while the deacon studies politics. At the same time, she<br>\r\n",
      "rather ironically reminds Mr. Scranton that the deacon is not guilty<br>\r\n",
      "of reading any long-winded articles on \"state rights and secession.\"<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not he!\" she says, laughingly; \"you don't catch him with such<br>\r\n",
      "cast-iron material in his head. They call him pious-proof now and<br>\r\n",
      "then, but he's progress all over.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton, attentive to his appetite, draws a serious face, gives<br>\r\n",
      "a side glance, begs a negro to supply his plate anew, and reckons he<br>\r\n",
      "may soon make a new discovery in southern political economy. But he<br>\r\n",
      "fears Mrs. Rosebrook's plan will make a mongrel, the specific nature<br>\r\n",
      "of which it would be difficult to define in philosophy. Perhaps it<br>\r\n",
      "will not be acceptable to the north as a thinking people, nor will<br>\r\n",
      "it please the generosity of southern ladies.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There is where the trouble lies!\" exclaimed the deacon, who had<br>\r\n",
      "until then yielded up the discussion to his good lady. \"They look<br>\r\n",
      "upon our system with distrust, as if it were something they could<br>\r\n",
      "not understand.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I move we don't say another word about it, but take our part<br>\r\n",
      "quietly,\" says Mrs. Rosebrook, insinuating that Mr. Scranton had<br>\r\n",
      "better be left to take his refreshment comfortably; that he is a<br>\r\n",
      "little misanthropic; that he must be cheered up. \"Come, my<br>\r\n",
      "boys\"-directing her conversation to the negroes-\"see that Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Scranton is cared for. And you must summon Daddy; tell him to get<br>\r\n",
      "the carriage ready, to put on his best blue coat,--that we are going<br>\r\n",
      "to take Mr. Scranton over the plantation, to show him how things can<br>\r\n",
      "prosper when we ladies take a hand in the management.\" The negro<br>\r\n",
      "leaves to execute the order: Mr. Scranton remains mute, now and then<br>\r\n",
      "sipping his wine. He imagines himself in a small paradise, but<br>\r\n",
      "\"hadn't the least idea how it was made such a place by niggers.\"<br>\r\n",
      "Why, they are just the smartest things in the shape of property that<br>\r\n",
      "could be started up. Regular dandy niggers, dressed up to \"shine<br>\r\n",
      "so,\" they set him thinking there was something in his politics not<br>\r\n",
      "just straight. And then, there was so much intelligence, so much<br>\r\n",
      "politeness about the critters! Why, if it had not been for the<br>\r\n",
      "doctrines he had so long held, he would have felt bashful at his<br>\r\n",
      "want of ease and suavity,--things seldom taught in the New England<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Presently servants are seen outside, running here and there, their<br>\r\n",
      "eyes glistening with anxiety, as if preparing for a May-day<br>\r\n",
      "festival. Old Dolly, the cook, shining with the importance of her<br>\r\n",
      "profession, stands her greasy portions in the kitchen door, scolds<br>\r\n",
      "away at old Dad, whose face smiles with good-nature as he fusses<br>\r\n",
      "over the carriage, wipes it, rubs it, and brushes it, every now and<br>\r\n",
      "then stopping to see if it will reflect his full black face. Little<br>\r\n",
      "woolly-headed urchins are toddling round old Maum Dolly, pulling the<br>\r\n",
      "folds of her frock, teasing for cakes and fritters. One, more expert<br>\r\n",
      "in mischief, has perched himself in an aperture over the door,<br>\r\n",
      "substituting himself for the old black hat with which it is usually<br>\r\n",
      "filled. Here, his face like a full moon in a cloud, he twists his<br>\r\n",
      "moving fingers into the ingeniously-tied knot of Dolly's bandana,<br>\r\n",
      "which he cunningly draws from her head. Ben and Loblolly, two minor<br>\r\n",
      "sprats of the race, are seated in the centre of the yard, contending<br>\r\n",
      "for the leaves of a picture-book, which, to appease their<br>\r\n",
      "characteristic inquisitiveness, they have dissected. Daddy has the<br>\r\n",
      "horses ready and the carriage waiting; and Uncle Bradshaw, the<br>\r\n",
      "coachman, and C�sar, the likely fellow, wait at the door with as<br>\r\n",
      "much satisfaction expressed in their faces as if it were all for<br>\r\n",
      "them. Missus is not to be outdone in expertness: a few minutes ago<br>\r\n",
      "she was \"snaring\" Mr. Scranton with his own philosophy; now she is<br>\r\n",
      "ready to take her seat.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Missus! I wants t' go down yander wid ye, I doe,\" says Daddy,<br>\r\n",
      "approaching her with hand extended, and working his black face up<br>\r\n",

      "getting into the carriage.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, Daddy, certainly: you shall go. Daddy knows how to get<br>\r\n",

      "knows where to get a good cup of coffee and a waff.\" And she pats<br>\r\n",
      "the old negro on the head as he clambers up on the box. \"No, him<br>\r\n",

      "taking off his cap, and bowing missus into the carriage.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not one word for mas'r, eh, Daddy?\" rejoins the deacon, looking<br>\r\n",
      "playfully at Daddy. \"Why, Boss, you aint nofin whin missus about,\"<br>\r\n",
      "returns Daddy, tauntingly, as he buttons his grey coat, and tells<br>\r\n",
      "Bradshaw to \"go ahead!\" Away they go, galloping over the plain,<br>\r\n",
      "through the swamp, for the plantation,--that model experiment doubted<br>\r\n",
      "by so many. Major Sprag, the politician, and Judge Snow, the<br>\r\n",
      "statesman, had declared publicly it never would do any good. With<br>\r\n",
      "them it was not practical,--it gave negroes too much liberty; and<br>\r\n",
      "they declared the system must be kept within the narrowest sphere of<br>\r\n",
      "law, or it would be destroyed for ever.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Onward the carriage bounded, and long before it reached the<br>\r\n",
      "plantation gate was espied by the negroes, who came sallying forth<br>\r\n",
      "from their white cabins, crying out at the top of their<br>\r\n",
      "voices-\"Missus comin'! Missus comin! Da'h missus-dat she! I know'd<br>\r\n",
      "missus wa' comin' t' day!\" and the music of their voices re-echoed<br>\r\n",
      "through the arbour of oaks that lined the road. Their tongues seemed<br>\r\n",
      "to have taken new impulse for the occasion. The dogs, at full run,<br>\r\n",
      "came barking to the gate; old daddies and mammas, with faces \"all<br>\r\n",
      "over smiles,\" followed in the train. And they were dressed so<br>\r\n",
      "tidily, looked so cheerful, and gave such expressions of their<br>\r\n",
      "exuberant feelings, that Mr. Scranton seemed quite at a loss how to<br>\r\n",
      "account for it. He had never before witnessed such a mingling of<br>\r\n",
      "fondness for owners,--the welcome sounds of \"God bless good missus!\"<br>\r\n",
      "They were at variance with the misanthropic ideas he had imbibed at<br>\r\n",
      "the north. And then there was a regular retinue of the \"small-fry<br>\r\n",
      "property\" bringing up the rear, with curious faces, and making the<br>\r\n",
      "jargon more confounding with the music of their voices. They<br>\r\n",
      "toddled, screamed, and shouted, clustered around the gate, and<br>\r\n",
      "before Daddy had time to dismount, had it wide open, and were<br>\r\n",
      "contending for the palm of shaking missus by the hand \"fust.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The carriage drives to the plantation house, followed by the train<br>\r\n",
      "of moving darkness, flocking around it like as many devotees before<br>\r\n",
      "an object of superstitious worship. Mas'r is only a secondary<br>\r\n",
      "consideration, Missus is the angel of their thoughts; her kindness<br>\r\n",
      "and perseverance in their behalf has softened their<br>\r\n",
      "feelings--stimulated their energy. How touching is the fondness and<br>\r\n",
      "tenderness of these degraded mortals! They love their benefactor.<br>\r\n",
      "And, too, there is a lesson in it worthy the statesman's<br>\r\n",
      "consideration,--it shows a knowledge of right, and a deep sense of<br>\r\n",
      "gratitude for kindness bestowed. Mrs. Rosebrook alights from the<br>\r\n",
      "carriage, receives their warm congratulations, and, turning to Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Scranton, touches him on the arm, and remarks:--\"Now, here they are.<br>\r\n",
      "Poor old bodies,\"--taking them by the hand in rotation-just like as<br>\r\n",
      "many children. \"What do you think of them, Mr. Scranton? do you not<br>\r\n",
      "find a softening sympathy creeping upon you? I forgot, though, your<br>\r\n",
      "political responsibility! Ah! that is the point with statesmen. You<br>\r\n",
      "feel a touch of conscience once in a while, but cannot speak for<br>\r\n",
      "fear of the consequences.\" And she laughs heartily at Mr. Scranton,<br>\r\n",
      "who draws his face into a very serious length. \"Pest the niggers!\"<br>\r\n",
      "he says, as they gather at his feet, asking all sorts of importune<br>\r\n",
      "questions.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My good lady is a regular reformer, you see, Mr. Scranton,\" rejoins<br>\r\n",
      "the deacon, as he follows that gentleman into the hall.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Scranton remarks, in reply, that such does not become caste, and<br>\r\n",
      "two pompous-looking servants set upon him brushing the dirt from<br>\r\n",
      "his clothes with great earnestness. The negroes understand Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Scranton at a glance; he is an amiable stoic!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mrs. Rosebrook disappears for a few minutes, and returns minus her<br>\r\n",
      "bonnet and mantle. She delights to have the old and the young around<br>\r\n",
      "her,--to study their characters, to hear their stories, their<br>\r\n",
      "grievances, and to relieve their wants. \"These little black imps,\"<br>\r\n",
      "she says, patting them on the head as they toddle around her,<br>\r\n",
      "\"They're just as full of interest as their shiny black skins are<br>\r\n",
      "full of mischief;\" and one after another, with hand extended, they<br>\r\n",
      "seek a recognition; and she takes them in her arms, fondling them<br>\r\n",
      "with the affection of a nurse.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Here's Toby, too; the little cunning rascal! He is as sleek as a<br>\r\n",
      "mole, a young coon,\" she ejaculates, stooping down and playfully<br>\r\n",
      "working her fingers over Toby's crispy hair, as he sits upon the<br>\r\n",
      "grass in front of the house, feasting on a huge sweet potato, with<br>\r\n",
      "which he has so bedaubed his face that it looks like a mask with the<br>\r\n",
      "terrific portrayed in the rolling of two immense white eyes. \"And<br>\r\n",
      "here is Nichol Garvio!\" and she turns to another, pats him on the<br>\r\n",
      "head, and shakes his hand. \"We mean to make a great man of him, you<br>\r\n",
      "see,--he has head enough to make a Congress man; who knows but that<br>\r\n",
      "he'll get there when he grows up?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Congress, happily, is beyond niggers,\" replies Mr. Scranton,<br>\r\n",
      "approving the lady: \"Congress is pure yet!\" Turning round, she<br>\r\n",
      "recommends Mr. Scranton to put his northern prejudices in his<br>\r\n",
      "pocket, where they will be safe when required for the purposes of<br>\r\n",
      "the south. \"A nigger 's a nigger all over the world,\" rejoins Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Scranton, significantly shrugging his shoulders and casting a<br>\r\n",
      "doubtful glance at the young type.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True! true!\" she returns, giving Mr. Scranton a look of pity. \"God<br>\r\n",
      "give us sight to see! We praise our forefathers-honest praise!-but<br>\r\n",
      "we forget what they did. They brought them here, poor wretches;<br>\r\n",
      "decoyed them, deceived them,--and now we wish them back at the very<br>\r\n",
      "time it would be impossible to live without them. How happy is the<br>\r\n",
      "mind that believes a 'nigger' must be a nigger for ever and ever;<br>\r\n",
      "and that we must do all in our power to keep him from being anything<br>\r\n",
      "else!\" And her soft blue eyes glowed with sympathy; it was the soul<br>\r\n",
      "of a noble woman intent on doing good. She had stepped from the<br>\r\n",
      "darkness of a political error into the airy height of light and<br>\r\n",
      "love.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Daddy and Bradshaw had taken care of the horses; the deacon greeted<br>\r\n",
      "his negroes as one by one they came to welcome him; and for each he<br>\r\n",
      "had a kind word, a joke, a shake of the hand, or an enquiry about<br>\r\n",
      "some missing member of a family. The scene presented an interesting<br>\r\n",
      "picture-the interest, policy, and good faith between master and<br>\r\n",
      "slave. No sooner were the horses cared for, than Daddy and Bradshaw<br>\r\n",
      "started for the \"cabins,\" to say welcome to the old folks, \"a heap<br>\r\n",
      "a' how de\" to the gals, and tell de boys, down yander, in de tater<br>\r\n",
      "patch, dat Missus come. They must have their touching<br>\r\n",
      "congratulations, interchange the news of the city for the gossip of<br>\r\n",
      "the plantation, and drink the cup of tea Mamma makes for the<br>\r\n",
      "occasion. Soon the plantation is all agog; and the homely, but neat<br>\r\n",
      "cabins, swarm with negroes of all ages, bustling here and there, and<br>\r\n",
      "making preparations for the evening supper, which Aunt Peggy, the<br>\r\n",
      "cook, has been instructed to prepare in her very best style.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The deacon joins his good lady, and, with Mr. Scranton, they prepare<br>\r\n",
      "to walk over and view the plantation. They are followed by a retinue<br>\r\n",
      "of old and young property, giving vent to their thoughts in<br>\r\n",
      "expressions of gratitude to Missus and Mas'r. A broad expanse of<br>\r\n",
      "rural beauty stretches towards the west, soft and enchanting. The<br>\r\n",
      "sun is sinking into the curtains of a refulgent cloud; its crimson<br>\r\n",
      "light casts a mellow shade over the broad landscape; the evening<br>\r\n",
      "breeze is wafting coolly over the foliage, a welcome relief to the<br>\r\n",
      "scorching heat of mid-day; the balmy atmosphere breathes sweetness<br>\r\n",
      "over the whole. To the north stands a clump of fine old oaks, high<br>\r\n",
      "above the distant \"bottom,\" reflecting in all their richness the<br>\r\n",
      "warm tints of the setting sun. The leaves rustle as they pass along;<br>\r\n",
      "long lines of cotton plants, with their healthy blossoms, brighten<br>\r\n",
      "in the evening shade; the corn bends under its fruit; the potato<br>\r\n",
      "field looks fresh and luxuriant, and negroes are gathering from the<br>\r\n",
      "slip-beds supplies of market gardening. There is but one appearance<br>\r\n",
      "among the workers-cheerfulness! They welcome Mas'r as he passes<br>\r\n",
      "along; and again busily employ themselves, hoeing, weeding, and<br>\r\n",
      "working at the roots of vines in search of destructive insects.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My overseers are all black, every one! I would'nt have a white one;<br>\r\n",
      "they are mostly tyrants,\" says the deacon, looking at his fields,<br>\r\n",
      "exultingly. \"And my overseers plan out the very best mode of<br>\r\n",
      "planting. They get through a heap of work, with a little kindness<br>\r\n",
      "and a little management. Those two things do a deal, Sir! Five years<br>\r\n",
      "ago, I projected this new system of managing negroes-or, rather my<br>\r\n",
      "lady planned it,--she is a great manager, you see,--and I adopted it.<br>\r\n",
      "You see how it has worked, Mr. Scranton.\" The deacon takes Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Scranton by the arm, pointing over the broad expanse of cultivated<br>\r\n",
      "land, bending under the harvest. I make all my negroes marry when<br>\r\n",
      "they have arrived at a specific age; I assure them I never will sell<br>\r\n",
      "one unless he or she commits a heinous crime; and I never have.<br>\r\n",
      "There is a great deal in keeping faith with a negro; he is of<br>\r\n",
      "mankind, and moved by natural laws mentally and physically, and<br>\r\n",
      "feels deeply the want of what we rarely regard of much<br>\r\n",
      "consequence-confidence in his master's word. Wife encourages their<br>\r\n",
      "moral energy; I encourage their physical by filling their bellies<br>\r\n",
      "with as much corn and bacon as they can eat; and then I give them<br>\r\n",
      "five cents per day (the heads of families) to get those little<br>\r\n",
      "necessaries which are so essential to their comfort and<br>\r\n",
      "encouragement. I call it our paid-labour system; and I give them<br>\r\n",
      "tasks, too, and when they have finished them I allow a small stipend<br>\r\n",
      "for extra work. It's a small mite for a great end; and it's such an<br>\r\n",
      "encouragement with them that I get about thirty per cent. more work<br>\r\n",
      "done. And then I allow them to read just as much as they please-what<br>\r\n",
      "do I care about law? I don't want to live where learning to read is<br>\r\n",
      "dangerous to the State, I don't. Their learning to read never can<br>\r\n",
      "destroy their affections for me and wife; and kindness to them will<br>\r\n",
      "make them less dangerous in case of insurrection. It's not the<br>\r\n",
      "education we've got to fear; our fears increase with the knowledge<br>\r\n",
      "of our oppression. They know these things-they feel them; and if by<br>\r\n",
      "educating them one can cultivate their confidence, had we not better<br>\r\n",
      "do it with a view to contingencies? Now, as the result of our<br>\r\n",
      "system, we have promised to give all our negroes their freedom at<br>\r\n",
      "the expiration of ten years, and send such as wish to go, to<br>\r\n",
      "Liberia; but, I hold that they can do as much for us at home, work<br>\r\n",
      "for us if properly encouraged, and be good free citizens, obedient<br>\r\n",
      "to the laws of the State, serving the general good of a great<br>\r\n",
      "country.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes!\" the good lady interposes; \"I want to see those things carried<br>\r\n",
      "out; they will yet work for the regeneration of their own race.<br>\r\n",
      "Heaven will some day reward the hand that drags the cursed mantle<br>\r\n",
      "from off poor Africa; and Africa herself will breathe a prayer to<br>\r\n",
      "Heaven in grateful acknowledgment of the act that frees her from the<br>\r\n",
      "stain of being the world's bonded warehouse for human flesh and<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The deacon interrupts,--suggests \"that it were better to move<br>\r\n",
      "practically; and that small streams may yet direct how a mountain<br>\r\n",
      "may be removed. Our Union is a great monument of what a Republic may<br>\r\n",
      "be,--a happy combination of life, freshness, and greatness, upon<br>\r\n",
      "which the Old World looks with distrust. The people have founded its<br>\r\n",

      "would be the greatest blessing that ever befell the South. It would<br>\r\n",
      "make some of your Christians blush,--perhaps ashamed.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ashamed! ashamed! a thing little used the way times are,\" he<br>\r\n",
      "mutters, fretting his fingers through his bristly hair, until it<br>\r\n",
      "stands erect like quills on a porcupine's back. This done, he<br>\r\n",
      "measuredly adjusts his glasses on the tip of his nose, giving his<br>\r\n",
      "tawny visage an appearance at once strange and indicative of all the<br>\r\n",
      "peculiarities of his peculiar character. \"It wasn't that,\" he says,<br>\r\n",
      "\"Marston did'nt get dissatisfied with my spiritual conditions; it<br>\r\n",

      "honour me, my dear madam, with a visit at my hospital, I am certain<br>\r\n",

      "motives.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" interrupts the lady, quickly, \"nothing would give me more<br>\r\n",
      "gratification,--I esteem any person engaged in a laudable pursuit;<br>\r\n",
      "but if philanthropy be expressed through the frailties of<br>\r\n",
      "speculation,--especially where it is carried out in the buying and<br>\r\n",
      "selling of afflicted men and women,--I am willing to admit the age of<br>\r\n",
      "progress to have got ahead of me. However, Elder, I suppose you go<br>\r\n",
      "upon the principle of what is not lost to sin being gained to the<br>\r\n",
      "Lord: and if your sick property die pious, the knowledge of it is a<br>\r\n",
      "sufficient recompense for the loss.\" Thus saying, she readily<br>\r\n",
      "accepted the Elder's kind invitation, and, ordering a basket of<br>\r\n",
      "prepared nourishment, which, together with the carriage, was soon<br>\r\n",
      "ready, she accompanied him to his infirmary. They drove through<br>\r\n",
      "narrow lanes and streets lined with small dilapidated cottages, and<br>\r\n",
      "reached a wooden tenement near the suburb of the city of C--. It was<br>\r\n",
      "surrounded by a lattice fence, the approach being through a gate, on<br>\r\n",
      "which was inscribed, \"Mr. Praiseworthy's Infirmary;\" and immediately<br>\r\n",
      "below this, in small letters, was the significant notice, \"Planters<br>\r\n",
      "having the cholera and other prevailing diseases upon their<br>\r\n",
      "plantations will please take notice that I am prepared to pay the<br>\r\n",

      "disease. Offers will be made for the most doubtful cases!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Elder Praiseworthy!\" ejaculates the lady, starting back, and<br>\r\n",
      "stopping to read the strange sign. \"'Offers will be made for the<br>\r\n",
      "most doubtful cases!'\" she mutters, turning towards him with a look<br>\r\n",
      "of melancholy. \"What thoughts, feelings, sentiments! That means,<br>\r\n",
      "that unto death you have a pecuniary interest in their bodies; and,<br>\r\n",
      "for a price, you will interpose between their owners and death. The<br>\r\n",
      "mind so grotesque as to conceive such a purpose should be<br>\r\n",
      "restrained, lest it trifle with life unconsciously.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You see,\" interrupts Mr. Praiseworthy, looking more serious than<br>\r\n",
      "ever, \"It's the life saved to the nigger; he's grateful for it; and<br>\r\n",
      "if they ain't pious just then, it gives them time to consider, to<br>\r\n",
      "prepare themselves. My little per centage is small-it's a mean<br>\r\n",
      "commission; and if it were not for the satisfaction of knowing how<br>\r\n",
      "much good I do, it wouldn't begin to pay a professional gentleman.\"<br>\r\n",
      "As the Elder concludes his remarks, melancholy sounds are breaking<br>\r\n",
      "forth in frightful discord. From strange murmurings it rises into<br>\r\n",
      "loud wailings and implorings. \"Take me, good Lord, to a world of<br>\r\n",
      "peace!\" sounds in her ears, as they approach through a garden and<br>\r\n",
      "enter a door that opens into a long room, a store-house of human<br>\r\n",
      "infirmity, where moans, cries, and groans are made a medium of<br>\r\n",
      "traffic. The room, about thirty feet long and twenty wide, is<br>\r\n",
      "rough-boarded, contains three tiers of narrow berths, one above the<br>\r\n",
      "other, encircling its walls. Here and there on the floor are cots,<br>\r\n",
      "which Mr. Praiseworthy informs us are for those whose cases he would<br>\r\n",
      "not give much for. Black nurses are busily attending the sick<br>\r\n",
      "property; some are carrying bowls of gruel, others rubbing limbs and<br>\r\n",
      "quieting the cries of the frantic, and again supplying water to<br>\r\n",
      "quench thirst. On a round table that stands in the centre of the<br>\r\n",
      "room is a large medicine-chest, disclosing papers, pills, powders,<br>\r\n",
      "phials, and plasters, strewn about in great disorder. A bedlam of<br>\r\n",
      "ghastly faces presents itself,--dark, haggard, and frantic with the<br>\r\n",
      "pains of the malady preying upon the victims. One poor wretch<br>\r\n",
      "springs from his couch, crying, \"Oh, death! death! come soon!\" and<br>\r\n",
      "his features glare with terror. Again he utters a wild shriek, and<br>\r\n",
      "bounds round the room, looking madly at one and another, as if<br>\r\n",
      "chased by some furious animal. The figure of a female, whose<br>\r\n",
      "elongated body seems ready to sink under its disease, sits on a<br>\r\n",
      "little box in the corner, humming a dolorous air, and looking with<br>\r\n",
      "glassy eyes pensively around the room at those stretched in their<br>\r\n",
      "berths. For a few seconds she is quiet; then, contorting her face<br>\r\n",
      "into a deep scowl, she gives vent to the most violent bursts of<br>\r\n",
      "passion,--holds her long black hair above her head, assumes a tragic<br>\r\n",
      "attitude, threatens to distort it from the scalp. \"That one's lost<br>\r\n",
      "her mind-she's fitty; but I think the devil has something to do with<br>\r\n",
      "her fits. And, though you wouldn't think it, she's just as harmless<br>\r\n",
      "as can be,\" Mr. Praiseworthy coolly remarks, looking at Mrs.<br>\r\n",
      "Rosebrook, hoping she will say something encouraging in reply. The<br>\r\n",
      "lady only replies by asking him if he purchased her from her owner?<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Praiseworthy responds in the affirmative, adding that she<br>\r\n",
      "doesn't seem to like it much. He, however, has strong hopes of<br>\r\n",
      "curing her mind, getting it \"in fix\" again, and making a good penny<br>\r\n",
      "on her. \"She's a'most white, and, unfortunately, took a liking to a<br>\r\n",
      "young man down town. Marston owned her then, and, being a friend of<br>\r\n",
      "hers, wouldn't allow it, and it took away her senses; he thought her<br>\r\n",
      "malady incurable, and sold her to me for a little or nothing,\" he<br>\r\n",
      "continues, with great complacency.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "This poor broken flower of misfortune holds down her head as the<br>\r\n",
      "lady approaches, gives a look of melancholy expressive of shame and<br>\r\n",
      "remorse. \"She's sensitive for a nigger, and the only one that has<br>\r\n",
      "said anything about being put among men,\" Mr. Praiseworthy remarks,<br>\r\n",
      "advancing a few steps, and then going from berth to berth,<br>\r\n",
      "descanting on the prospects of his sick, explaining their various<br>\r\n",
      "diseases, their improvements, and his doubts of the dying. The lady<br>\r\n",
      "watches all his movements, as if more intently interested in Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Praiseworthy's strange character. \"And here's one,\" he says, \"I fear<br>\r\n",
      "I shall lose; and if I do, there's fifty dollars gone, slap!\" and he<br>\r\n",
      "points to an emaciated yellow man, whose body is literally a crust<br>\r\n",
      "of sores, and whose painful implorings for water and nourishment are<br>\r\n",
      "deep and touching.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Poor wretch!\" Mr. Praiseworthy exclaims, \"I wish I'd never bought<br>\r\n",
      "him-it's pained my feelings so; but I did it to save his life when<br>\r\n",
      "he was most dead with the rheumatics, and was drawn up as crooked as<br>\r\n",
      "branch cord-wood. And then, after I had got the cinques out of him-<br>\r\n",
      "after nearly getting him straight for a 'prime fellow' (good care<br>\r\n",
      "did the thing), he took the water on the chest, and is grown out<br>\r\n",
      "like that.\" He points coolly to the sufferer's breast, which is<br>\r\n",
      "fearfully distended with disease; saying that, \"as if that wasn't<br>\r\n",
      "enough, he took the lepors, and it's a squeak if they don't end<br>\r\n",
      "him.\" He pities the \"crittur,\" but has done all he can for him,<br>\r\n",
      "which he would have done if he hadn't expected a copper for selling<br>\r\n",
      "him when cured. \"So you see, madam,\" he reiterates, \"it isn't all<br>\r\n",
      "profit. I paid a good price for the poor skeleton, have had all ny<br>\r\n",
      "trouble, and shall have no gain-except the recompense of feeling.<br>\r\n",
      "There was a time when I might have shared one hundred and fifty<br>\r\n",
      "dollars by him, but I felt humane towards him; didn't want him to<br>\r\n",
      "slide until he was a No. 1.\" Thus the Elder sets forth his own<br>\r\n",
      "goodness of heart.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Pray, what do you pay a head for them, Mr. Praiseworthy?\" enquires<br>\r\n",
      "the lady, smoothing her hand over the feverish head of the poor<br>\r\n",
      "victim, as the carnatic of her cheek changed to pallid languor.<br>\r\n",
      "Pursuing her object with calmness, she determined not to display her<br>\r\n",
      "emotions until fully satisfied how far the Elder would go.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"That, madam, depends on cases; cripples are not worth much. But,<br>\r\n",
      "now and then, we get a legless fellow what's sound in body, can get<br>\r\n",
      "round sprightly, and such like; and, seeing how we can make him<br>\r\n",
      "answer a sight of purposes, he'll bring something,\" he sedately<br>\r\n",
      "replies, with muscles unmoved. \"Cases what doctors give up as 'done<br>\r\n",
      "gone,' we gets for ten and twenty dollars; cases not hanging under<br>\r\n",
      "other diseases, we give from thirty to fifty-and so on! Remember,<br>\r\n",
      "however, you must deduct thirty per cent. for death. At times, where<br>\r\n",
      "you would make two or three hundred dollars by curing one, and<br>\r\n",
      "saving his life, you lose three, sometimes half-a-dozen head.\" The<br>\r\n",
      "Elder consoles his feelings with the fact that it is not all profit,<br>\r\n",
      "looks highly gratified, puts a large cut of tobacco in his mouth,<br>\r\n",
      "thanks God that the common school-bill didn't pass in the<br>\r\n",
      "legislature, and that his business is more humane than people<br>\r\n",
      "generally admit.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"How many have you in all?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"The number of head, I suppose? Well, there's about thirty sick, and<br>\r\n",
      "ten well ones what I sent to market last week. Did-n-'t-make-a-good<br>\r\n",
      "market, though,\" he drawls out.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You are alone in the business?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well, no; I've a partner-Jones; there's a good many phases in the<br>\r\n",
      "business, you see, and one can't get along. Jones was a<br>\r\n",
      "nigger-broker, and Jones and me went into partnership to do the<br>\r\n",
      "thing smooth up, on joint account. I does the curing, and he does<br>\r\n",
      "the selling, and we both turns a dollar or two-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Oh, horrors!\" interrupts the lady, looking at Mr. Praiseworthy<br>\r\n",
      "sarcastically. \"Murder will out, men's sentiments will betray them,<br>\r\n",
      "selfishness will get above them all; ornament them as you will,<br>\r\n",
      "their ornaments will drop,--naked self will uncover herself and be<br>\r\n",
      "the deceiver.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not at all!\" the Elder exclaims, in his confidence. \"The Lord's<br>\r\n",
      "will is in everything; without it we could not battle with the<br>\r\n",
      "devil; we relieve suffering humanity, and the end justifies the<br>\r\n",
      "means.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You should have left out the means: it is only the end you aim at.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"That's like accusing Deacon Seabury of impious motives, because he<br>\r\n",
      "shaves notes at an illegal interest. It's worse-because what the law<br>\r\n",
      "makes legal the church should not make sinful.\" This is<br>\r\n",
      "Praiseworthy's philosophy, which he proclaims while forgetting the<br>\r\n",
      "existence of a law of conscience having higher claims than the<br>\r\n",
      "technicalities of statutes. We must look to that to modify our<br>\r\n",
      "selfishness, to strengthen our love for human laws when founded in<br>\r\n",
      "justice.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And who is this poor girl?\" enquires Mrs. Rosebrook, stepping<br>\r\n",
      "softly forward, and taking her by the hand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Marston's once; some Indian in her, they say. She's right fair<br>\r\n",
      "looks when she's herself. Marston's in trouble now, and the cholera<br>\r\n",
      "has made sad havoc of his niggers,\" Mr. Praiseworthy replies,<br>\r\n",
      "placing a chair, and motioning his hand for the lady to be seated.<br>\r\n",
      "The lady seats herself beside the girl,--takes her hand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, missus; God bless good missus. Ye don't know me now,\" mutters<br>\r\n",
      "the poor girl, raising her wild glassy eyes, as she parts the long<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My child, who has made you this wretch?\" says the good lady,<br>\r\n",
      "pressing her tawny hand.<br>\r\n",

      "as if terrified, she grasps tighter the lady's hand, while her<br>\r\n",

      "the crop carefully watched. Graspum, however, had secured himself in<br>\r\n",
      "the real estate, and gave little heed to the epidemic that was<br>\r\n",
      "carrying off the negro property. Finally, to pass over several<br>\r\n",
      "stages in the decline of Marston's affairs, the ravages of the<br>\r\n",
      "disease continued until but forty-three negroes, old and young,<br>\r\n",
      "were left on the old homestead. The culminating point had arrived.<br>\r\n",
      "He was in the grasp of Graspum, and nothing could save him from<br>\r\n",
      "utter ruin. It had lately been proved that the Rovero family,<br>\r\n",
      "instead of being rich, were extremely poor, their plantation having<br>\r\n",
      "long been under a mortgage, the holder of which was threatening<br>\r\n",
      "foreclosure.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "With Marston, an amount of promiscuous debts had accumulated so far<br>\r\n",
      "beyond his expectation that he was without means of discharging<br>\r\n",
      "them. His affairs became more and more confused, while the amount of<br>\r\n",
      "his liabilities remained a perfect obscurity to the community.<br>\r\n",
      "Rumour began to disseminate his troubles, suspicion summoned her<br>\r\n",
      "charges, and town-talk left little unadded; while those of his<br>\r\n",
      "creditors who had been least suspicious of his wealth and honour<br>\r\n",
      "became the most importunate applicants for their claims. At length,<br>\r\n",
      "driven by the pressure of the times, he calls Clotilda to him, and<br>\r\n",
      "tells her that he is resolved to send Annette and Nicholas into the<br>\r\n",
      "city, where they will remain in the care of a coloured woman, until<br>\r\n",
      "an opportunity offers of sending them to the north. He is fond of<br>\r\n",
      "Clotilda,--tells her of the excitement concerning his business<br>\r\n",
      "affairs, and impresses her with the necessity of preserving<br>\r\n",
      "calmness; it is requisite to the evasion of any ulterior consequence<br>\r\n",
      "that may be brought upon him. Every-thing hangs upon a thread-a<br>\r\n",
      "political thread, a lawful thread-a thread that holds the fate of<br>\r\n",
      "thirty, forty, or fifty human beings-that separates them from that<br>\r\n",
      "verge of uncertainty upon which a straw may turn the weal or woe of<br>\r\n",
      "their lives. \"When I get them comfortably cared for, Clotilda, I<br>\r\n",
      "will send for you. Nicholas's mother has gone, but you shall be a<br>\r\n",
      "mother to them both,\" he says, looking upon her seriously, as if<br>\r\n",
      "contemplating the trouble before him in the attempt to rescue his<br>\r\n",
      "children.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You will not send Annette away without me?\" she inquires, quickly,<br>\r\n",
      "falling on her knees at his side, and reiterating, \"Don't send<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"The separation will only be for a few days. Annette shall be<br>\r\n",

      "together you shall go where your parentage will not shame you,--where<br>\r\n",
      "you may ornament society,\" he replies, as Clotilda's face lights up<br>\r\n",
      "with satisfaction. With such an assurance-she does not comprehend<br>\r\n",
      "the tenour of his troubles-her freedom seems at hand: it excites her<br>\r\n",
      "to joy. Marston retires and she takes his seat, writes a note to<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell, who is then in the city, relating what has transpired, and<br>\r\n",
      "concluding with a request that he will call and see her.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "A few days passed, and the two children were sent into the city and<br>\r\n",
      "placed in the charge of a free woman, with instructions to keep them<br>\r\n",
      "secreted for several weeks. This movement being discovered by<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos, was the first signal for an onset of creditors. Graspum,<br>\r\n",
      "always first to secure himself, in this instance compelled Marston<br>\r\n",
      "to succumb to his demands by threatening to disclose the crime<br>\r\n",
      "Lorenzo had committed. Forcing him to fulfil the obligation in the<br>\r\n",
      "bond, he took formal possession of the plantation. This increased<br>\r\n",
      "the suspicion of fraud; there was a mystery somewhere,--nobody could<br>\r\n",
      "solve it. Marston, even his former friends declared, was a swindler.<br>\r\n",
      "He could not be honestly indebted in so large an amount to Graspum;<br>\r\n",
      "nor could he be so connected with such persons without something<br>\r\n",
      "being wrong somewhere. Friends began to insinuate that they had been<br>\r\n",
      "misled; and not a few among those who had enjoyed his hospitality<br>\r\n",
      "were first inclined to scandalise his integrity. Graspum had<br>\r\n",
      "foreseen all this, and, with Romescos, who had purloined the bill of<br>\r\n",
      "sale, was prepared to do any amount of swearing. Marston is a victim<br>\r\n",
      "of circumstances; his proud spirit prompts him to preserve from<br>\r\n",
      "disgrace the name of his family, and thus he the more easily yielded<br>\r\n",
      "to the demands of the betrayer. Hence, Graspum, secure in his<br>\r\n",
      "ill-gotten booty, leaves his victim to struggle with those who come<br>\r\n",
      "after him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "A few weeks pass over, and the equity of Graspum's claim is<br>\r\n",
      "questioned: his character for honour being doubted, gives rise to<br>\r\n",
      "much comment. The whole thing is denounced-proclaimed a concerted<br>\r\n",
      "movement to defraud the rightful creditors. And yet, knowing the<br>\r\n",
      "supremacy of money over law in a slave state, Graspum's power, the<br>\r\n",
      "revenge his followers inflict, and their desperate character, not<br>\r\n",
      "one dare come forward to test the validity of the debt. They know<br>\r\n",
      "and fear the fierce penalty: they are forced to fall back,--to seize<br>\r\n",
      "his person, his property, his personal effects.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "In this dilemma, Marston repairs to the city, attempts to make an<br>\r\n",
      "arrangement with his creditors, singularly fails; he can effect<br>\r\n",
      "nothing. Wherever he goes his salutation meets a cold, measured<br>\r\n",
      "response; whisper marks him a swindler. The knife stabs deep into<br>\r\n",
      "the already festered wound. Misfortune bears heavily upon a<br>\r\n",
      "sensitive mind; but accusation of wrong, when struggling under<br>\r\n",
      "trials, stabs deepest into the heart, and bears its victim suffering<br>\r\n",
      "to the very depths of despair.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "To add to this combination of misfortunes, on his return to the<br>\r\n",
      "plantation he found it deserted,--a sheriff's keeper guarding his<br>\r\n",
      "personal effects, his few remaining negroes seized upon and marched<br>\r\n",
      "into the city for the satisfaction of his debts. Clotilda has been<br>\r\n",
      "seized upon, manacled, driven to the city, committed to prison.<br>\r\n",
      "Another creditor has found out the hiding-place of the children;<br>\r\n",
      "directs the sheriff, who seizes upon them, like property of their<br>\r\n",
      "kind, and drags them to prison. Oh, that prison walls were made for<br>\r\n",
      "torturing the innocent!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Marston is left poor upon the world; Ellen Juvarna is in the hands<br>\r\n",
      "of a resurrectionist; Nicholas-a bright boy he has grown-is within<br>\r\n",
      "the dark confines of a prison cell, along with Clotilda and Annette.<br>\r\n",
      "Melancholy broods over the plantation now. The act of justice,--the<br>\r\n",
      "right which Marston saw through wrong, and which he had intended to<br>\r\n",
      "carry out,--is now beyond his power. Stripped of those comforts he<br>\r\n",
      "had enjoyed, his offspring carried off as trophies of<br>\r\n",
      "avarice,--perhaps for sale to some ruffian who would set a price upon<br>\r\n",
      "their beauty,--he sits down, sick at heart, and weeps a child's<br>\r\n",
      "tears. The mansion, so long the scene of pleasure and hospitality,<br>\r\n",
      "is like a deserted barrack;-still, gloomy, cold, in the absence of<br>\r\n",
      "familiar faces. No servant comes to call him master,--Dandy and Enoch<br>\r\n",
      "are gone; and those familiar words, so significant of affection<br>\r\n",
      "between master and slave, \"Glad to see ye home, mas'r,\" no longer<br>\r\n",
      "sounded in his ears. Even his overseer has become alarmed, and like<br>\r\n",
      "the rest levied for arrears of wages.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "There is nothing for Marston but to give up all,--to leave the home<br>\r\n",
      "of his childhood, his manhood, his happier days. He is suddenly<br>\r\n",
      "reminded that there is virtue in fortitude; and, as he gazes round<br>\r\n",
      "the room, the relics of happier days redouble his conviction of the<br>\r\n",
      "evil he has brought upon himself by straying from the paths of<br>\r\n",
      "rectitude. Indeed, so sudden was his fall from distinction, that the<br>\r\n",
      "scene around him seemed like a dream, from which he had just awoke<br>\r\n",
      "to question its precipitancy. \"A sheriff is here now, and I am a<br>\r\n",
      "mere being of sufferance,\" he says, casting a moody glance around<br>\r\n",
      "the room, as if contemplating the dark prospect before him. A few<br>\r\n",
      "moments' pause, and he rises, walks to the window, looks out upon<br>\r\n",
      "the serene scene spread out before the mansion. There is the river,<br>\r\n",
      "on which he has spent so many pleasant hours, calmly winding its way<br>\r\n",
      "through deep green foliage mellowed by the moonlight. Its beauties<br>\r\n",
      "only remind him of the past. He walks away,--struggles to forget, to<br>\r\n",
      "look above his trials. He goes to the old side-board that has so<br>\r\n",
      "long given forth its cheer; that, too, is locked! \"Locked to me!\" he<br>\r\n",
      "says, attempting to open its doors. A sheriff's lock hangs upon<br>\r\n",
      "them. Accustomed to every indulgence, each check indicated a doubt<br>\r\n",
      "of his honour, wounding his feelings. The smaller the restraint the<br>\r\n",
      "deeper did it pierce his heart. While in this desponding mood,<br>\r\n",
      "vainly endeavouring to gain resolution to carry him through, a<br>\r\n",
      "gentle rap is heard at the door. Who can it be at this hour? he<br>\r\n",
      "questions to himself. No servant is near him; servants have all been<br>\r\n",
      "led into captivity for the satisfaction of debts. He approaches the<br>\r\n",
      "door and opens it himself, looking cautiously into the corridor.<br>\r\n",
      "There, crouched in a niche, alternately presenting fear and<br>\r\n",
      "joy,--fear lest he be seen by the enemy, and joy to see his<br>\r\n",
      "master,--is a dark figure with the familiar face of Daddy Bob,--Bob of<br>\r\n",
      "the old plantation. The old, faithful servant puts out his wrinkled<br>\r\n",
      "hand nervously, saying, \"Oh, good mas'r!\" He has looked up to<br>\r\n",
      "Marston with the same love that an affectionate child does to a kind<br>\r\n",
      "parent; he has enjoyed mas'r's warm welcome, nurtured his<br>\r\n",
      "confidence, had his say in directing the affairs of the plantation,<br>\r\n",
      "and watched the frailties that threatened it.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Why, Daddy Bob! Can it be you?\" Marston says, modulating his voice,<br>\r\n",
      "as a change comes over his feelings.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Dis is me, mas'r; it is me,\" again says the old man. He is wet with<br>\r\n",
      "the night dew, but his heart is warm and affectionate. Marston<br>\r\n",
      "seizes his hand as if to return the old man's gratitude, and leads<br>\r\n",
      "him into the room, smiling. \"Sit down, Bob, sit down!\" he says,<br>\r\n",
      "handing him a chair. The old servant stands at the chair<br>\r\n",
      "hesitatingly, doubting his position. \"Fear nothing, Bob; sit down.<br>\r\n",
      "You are my best friend,\" Marston continues. Bob takes a seat, lays<br>\r\n",
      "his cap quietly upon the floor, smiles to see old mas'r, but don't<br>\r\n",
      "feel just right because there's something wrong: he draws the laps<br>\r\n",
      "of his jacket together, covers the remnant of a shirt. \"Mas'r, what<br>\r\n",
      "be da' gwine to do wid de old plantation? Tings, Bob reckon, b'nt<br>\r\n",
      "gwine straight,\" he speaks, looking at Marston shyly. The old slave<br>\r\n",
      "knew his master's heart, and had waited for him to unfold its<br>\r\n",
      "beatings; but the kind heart of the master yielded to the burden<br>\r\n",
      "that was upon it, and never more so than when moved by the strong<br>\r\n",
      "attachment evinced by the old man. There was mutual sympathy<br>\r\n",
      "pourtrayed in the tenderest emotions. The one was full of grief,<br>\r\n",
      "and, if touched by the word of a friend, would overflow; the other<br>\r\n",
      "was susceptible of kindness, knew something had befallen his master,<br>\r\n",
      "and was ready to present the best proofs of his attachment.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And how did you get here, my old faithful?\" inquires Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "drawing nearer to him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well, mas'r, ye see, t'ant just so wid nigger what don' know how<br>\r\n",
      "tings is! But, Bob up t' dese tings. I sees Buckra, what look as if<br>\r\n",
      "he hab no rights on dis plantation, grab'n up all de folks. And<br>\r\n",
      "Lor,' mas'r, old Bob could'nt leave mas'r no how. An, den, when da'<br>\r\n",
      "begins to chain de folks up-da' chain up old Rachel, mas'r!-Old Bob<br>\r\n",
      "feel so de plantation war'nt no-whare; and him time t'be gwine. Da'h<br>\r\n",
      "an't gwine t' cotch old Bob, and carry 'm way from mas'r, so I jist<br>\r\n",
      "cum possum ober dem-stows away yander, down close in de old corn<br>\r\n",
      "crib,--\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And you eluded the sheriff to take care of me, did you, Daddy?\"<br>\r\n",
      "interrupts Marston, and again takes the old man's hand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Oh, mas'r, Bob ain't white, but 'is feeling get so fo' h mas'r, he<br>\r\n",
      "can't speak 'em,\" the old slave replies, pearls glistening in his<br>\r\n",
      "eyes. \"My feelings feel so, I can't speak 'em!\" And with a brother's<br>\r\n",
      "fondness he shakes his master's hand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We must beg the reader's indulgence here for the purpose of making a<br>\r\n",
      "few remarks upon the negro's power of observation. From the many<br>\r\n",
      "strange disquisitions that have been put forward on the mental<br>\r\n",
      "qualities of the man of colour-more particularly the African-few can<br>\r\n",
      "be selected which have not had for their object his<br>\r\n",
      "disqualification. His power of observation has been much<br>\r\n",
      "undervalued; but it has been chiefly by those who judge him by a<br>\r\n",
      "superficial scale, or from a selfish motive. In the position of mere<br>\r\n",
      "property, he is, of necessity, compelled to yield all claims to<br>\r\n",
      "mental elevation. And yet, forced to degradation, there are few<br>\r\n",
      "negroes on the plantation, or in the spheres of labour, who do not<br>\r\n",
      "note the rise and fall of their master's fortunes, study the nature<br>\r\n",
      "and prospects of the crop, make enquiries about the market, concoct<br>\r\n",
      "the best economy in managing lands, and consult among themselves as<br>\r\n",
      "to what would promote the interests of the whole. So far is this<br>\r\n",
      "carried out, that in many districts a rivalry for the largest amount<br>\r\n",
      "of crop on a given space is carried on among the slaves, who not<br>\r\n",
      "unfrequently \"chafe\" each other upon the superior wealth and talent<br>\r\n",
      "of their masters. It is a well-known fact, that John C. Calhoun's<br>\r\n",
      "slaves, in addition to being extremely fond of him, were proud and<br>\r\n",
      "boastful of his talent.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Daddy Bob is an exemplification. The faithful old slave had become<br>\r\n",
      "sensible of something wrong on the plantation: he saw the sheriff<br>\r\n",
      "seizing upon the families, secreted himself in the corn crib, and<br>\r\n",
      "fled to the woods when they were out of sight. Here, sheltered by<br>\r\n",
      "the myrtle, he remained until midnight, intently watching the<br>\r\n",
      "mansion for signs of old mas'r. Suddenly a light glimmers from the<br>\r\n",
      "window; the old slave's feelings bound with joy; he feels it an<br>\r\n",
      "invitation for him to return, and, leaving his hiding-place,<br>\r\n",
      "approaches the house stealthily, and descries his master at the<br>\r\n",
      "window. Confidence returns, his joy is complete, his hopes have not<br>\r\n",
      "misled him. Hungry and wet, he has found his way back to master,<br>\r\n",
      "whose face at the window gladdens his heart,--carries him beyond the<br>\r\n",
      "bounds of caution. Hence the cordial greeting between the old slave<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Again, Maxwell remembered that Marston had unfolded his troubles to<br>\r\n",

      "reciprocity. If it were merely an act dictated by the impulse of his<br>\r\n",
      "feelings at that moment, the secret was now laid broadly open. He<br>\r\n",
      "was father of the children, and, sensible of their critical<br>\r\n",
      "situation, the sting was goading him to their rescue. The question<br>\r\n",
      "was-would he interpose and declare them as such? Ah, he forgot it<br>\r\n",
      "was not the father's assertion,--it was the law. The crime of being<br>\r\n",
      "property was inherited from the mother. Acknowledging them his<br>\r\n",
      "children would neither satisfy law nor the creditors. What<br>\r\n",
      "honourable-we except the modernly chivalrous-man would see his<br>\r\n",
      "children jostled by the ruffian trader? What man, with feelings less<br>\r\n",
      "sensitive than iron, would see his child sold to the man-vender for<br>\r\n",
      "purposes so impious that heaven and earth frowned upon them? And yet<br>\r\n",
      "the scene was no uncommon one; slavery affords the medium, and men,<br>\r\n",
      "laying their hearts aside, make it serve their pockets. Those whom<br>\r\n",
      "it would insult to call less than gentlemen have covered their<br>\r\n",
      "scruples with the law, while consigning their own offspring to the<br>\r\n",
      "hand of an auctioneer. Man property is subvervient material,--woman<br>\r\n",
      "is even more; for where her virtue forms its tissues, and can be<br>\r\n",
      "sold, the issue is indeed deplorable. Again, where vice is made a<br>\r\n",
      "pleasure, and the offspring of it become a burden on our hands,<br>\r\n",
      "slavery affords the most convenient medium of getting rid of the<br>\r\n",
      "incumbrance. They sell it, perhaps profitably, and console<br>\r\n",
      "themselves with the happy recollection of what a great thing it is<br>\r\n",
      "to live in a free country, where one may get rid of such things<br>\r\n",
      "profitably. It may save our shame in the eyes of man, but God sees<br>\r\n",
      "all,--records the wrong!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Thus Maxwell contemplated the prospects before him. At length he<br>\r\n",
      "resolved to visit Marston upon his plantation, impress him with the<br>\r\n",
      "necessity of asserting their freedom, in order to save them from<br>\r\n",
      "being sold with the effects of the estate.<br>\r\n",

      "generous friend, who has entertained him so hospitably, sits in a<br>\r\n",
      "little ante-chamber, pensively, as if something of importance has<br>\r\n",
      "absorbed his attention. No well-dressed servants welcome him with<br>\r\n",
      "their smiles and grimaces; no Franconia greets him with her<br>\r\n",
      "vivacity, her pleasing conversation, her frankness and fondness for<br>\r\n",
      "the old servants. No table is decked out with the viands of the<br>\r\n",
      "season-Marston's viands have turned into troubles,--loneliness reigns<br>\r\n",
      "throughout. It is night, and nothing but the dull sound of the<br>\r\n",
      "keeper's tread breaks the silence. His (Maxwell's) mission is a<br>\r\n",
      "delicate one. It may be construed as intrusive, he thinks. But its<br>\r\n",
      "importance outweighs the doubt, and, though he approaches with<br>\r\n",
      "caution, is received with that embrace of friendship which a<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman can claim as his own when he feels the justice of the<br>\r\n",
      "mission of him who approaches, even though its tenor be painful.<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell hesitated for a few moments, looked silently upon the scene.<br>\r\n",
      "Trouble had already left its prints of sadness upon Marston's<br>\r\n",
      "countenance; the past, full of happy associations, floated in his<br>\r\n",
      "mind; the future--ah! that was--. Happily, at that moment, he had<br>\r\n",
      "been contemplating the means by which he could save Clotilda and the<br>\r\n",
      "children. He rises, approaches Maxwell, hands him a chair, listens<br>\r\n",
      "to his proposal. \"If I can assist you, we will save them,\" concludes<br>\r\n",
      "Maxwell.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"That,\" he replies, doubtingly, \"my good friend, has engaged my<br>\r\n",
      "thoughts by night and day--has made me most uneasy. Misfortune likes<br>\r\n",
      "sympathy; your words are as soothing as praiseworthy. I will defend<br>\r\n",
      "my children if every creditor call me swindler. I will destroy the<br>\r\n",
      "infernal bill of sale,--I will crush the hell-born paper that gives<br>\r\n",
      "life to deeds so bloody,--I will free them from the shame!\" Thus, his<br>\r\n",
      "feelings excited to the uttermost, he rises from his seat,<br>\r\n",
      "approaches a cupboard, draws forth the small trunk we have before<br>\r\n",
      "described, unlocks it. \"That fatal document is here, I put it here,<br>\r\n",
      "I will destroy it now; I will save them through its destruction.<br>\r\n",
      "There shall be no evidence of Clotilda's mother being a slave, oh<br>\r\n",
      "no!\" he mutters rapidly, running his fingers over packages, papers,<br>\r\n",
      "and documents. Again he glances vacantly over the whole file,<br>\r\n",
      "examining paper after paper, carefully. He looks in vain. It is not<br>\r\n",
      "there; there is no document so fatal. Sharper men have taken better<br>\r\n",
      "care of it. \"It is not here!\" he whispers, his countenance becoming<br>\r\n",
      "pallid and death-like. \"Not here!\"-and they will swear to suit their<br>\r\n",
      "purposes. Oaths are only worth what they bring in the market, among<br>\r\n",
      "slave dealers. But, who can have taken it?\" he continues, looking<br>\r\n",
      "wildly at Maxwell. Consternation is pictured on his countenance; he<br>\r\n",
      "feels there is intrigue at work, and that the want of that paper<br>\r\n",
      "will prove fatal to his resolution. A man in trouble always confides<br>\r\n",
      "in others, sometimes those whom he would scarce have trusted before.<br>\r\n",
      "He throws the paper aside, takes a seat at Maxwell's side, grasps<br>\r\n",
      "him by the hand, saying, \"My friend! save them! save them! save<br>\r\n",
      "them! Use what stratagem you please; make it the experiment of your<br>\r\n",
      "life. Consummate it, and a penitent's prayer will bless you! I see<br>\r\n",
      "the impending catastrophe-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We may do without it; be quiet. Let your feelings calm. I have<br>\r\n",
      "consulted Franconia on the same subject. Woman can do much if she<br>\r\n",
      "will; and she has promised me she will. My knowledge of her womanly<br>\r\n",
      "nature tells me she will be true to Clotilda!\" Maxwell speaks<br>\r\n",
      "assuringly, and his words seem as balm to a wounded spirit.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The bill of sale was among the things intended for a more profitable<br>\r\n",
      "use. Marston has satisfied Graspum's claim; but he knew that slavery<br>\r\n",
      "deadened the sensibilities of men. Yet, could it have so deadened<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum's feeling that he would have been found in a plot against<br>\r\n",
      "him? No! he could not believe it. He would not look for foul play<br>\r\n",
      "from that quarter. It might have been mislaid-if lost, all the<br>\r\n",
      "better. A second thought, and he begins to quiet himself with the<br>\r\n",
      "belief that it had become extinct; that, there not being evidence to<br>\r\n",
      "prove them property, his word would be sufficient to procure their<br>\r\n",
      "release. Somewhat relieved of the force of parental anxiety-we can<br>\r\n",
      "call it by no other name-the troubled planter, with his troubles<br>\r\n",
      "inherited, promises Maxwell, who has postponed his departure that he<br>\r\n",
      "may aid in saving Clotilda and her child, that he will proceed<br>\r\n",
      "direct to the sheriff's office, give notice of their freedom to that<br>\r\n",
      "functionary, and forbid the sale. Upon this resolution they part for<br>\r\n",
      "the night, and on the following morning, Marston, sick at heart,<br>\r\n",
      "leaves for the city, hoping to make arrangements with his attorney,<br>\r\n",
      "who will serve notice of freedom with all the expense and legality<br>\r\n",
      "of form.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The reader will excuse us for passing over many things of minor<br>\r\n",
      "importance which take place during the progress of arrangements<br>\r\n",
      "between Marston and the attorney, Mr. Dyson--commonly called Thomas<br>\r\n",
      "Dyson, Esq., wonderfully clever in the practice of slave law--and<br>\r\n",
      "proceeding to where we find the notice formally served. The document<br>\r\n",
      "forbids the sale of certain persons, physically and mentally<br>\r\n",
      "described, according to the nicest rules of law and tenour of trade;<br>\r\n",
      "and is, with the dignity of legal proceedings, served on the<br>\r\n",
      "honourable sheriff. We give a portion of it, for those who are not<br>\r\n",
      "informed on such curious matters: it runs thus:--\"'The girl<br>\r\n",
      "Clotilda-aged 27 years; her child Annette-aged 7 years, and a<br>\r\n",
      "remarkable boy, Nicholas, 6 years old, all negroes, levied upon at<br>\r\n",
      "the suit of--, to satisfy a fi fa issued from the--, and set forth<br>\r\n",
      "to be the property of Hugh Marston of--, &c. &c.;'\" as set forth in<br>\r\n",
      "the writ of attachment. Thus runs the curious law, based on<br>\r\n",
      "privilege, not principle.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The document served on the sheriff, Marston resolved to remain a few<br>\r\n",
      "days in the city and watch its effect. The sheriff, who is seldom<br>\r\n",
      "supposed to evince sympathy in his duties, conforms with the<br>\r\n",
      "ordinary routine of law in nigger cases; and, in his turn, gives<br>\r\n",
      "notice to the plaintiff, who is required to enter security for the<br>\r\n",
      "purpose of testing the point of freedom. Freedom here is a slender<br>\r\n",
      "commodity; it can be sworn away for a small compensation. Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Anthony Romescos has peculiar talent that way, and his services are<br>\r\n",
      "always in the market. The point, however, has not resolved itself<br>\r\n",
      "into that peculiar position where it must be either a matter of<br>\r\n",
      "compromise, or a question for the court and jury to decide.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "If Marston, now sensible of his position as father of the children,<br>\r\n",
      "will yield them a sacrifice to the man trader, it is in his power;<br>\r\n",
      "the creditors will make it their profit. Who, then, can solve the<br>\r\n",
      "perplexity for him? The custom of society, pointing the finger of<br>\r\n",
      "shame, denies him the right to acknowledge them his children.<br>\r\n",
      "Society has established the licentious wrong,--the law protects it,<br>\r\n",
      "custom enforces it. He can only proceed by declaring the mother to<br>\r\n",
      "be a free woman, and leaving the producing proof to convict her of<br>\r\n",
      "being slave property to the plaintiff. In doing this, his judgment<br>\r\n",
      "wars with his softer feelings. Custom--though it has nothing to give<br>\r\n",
      "him-is goading him with its advice; it tells him to abandon the<br>\r\n",
      "unfashionable, unpolite scheme. Natural laws have given birth to<br>\r\n",
      "natural feelings--natural affections are stronger than bad laws. They<br>\r\n",
      "burn with our nature,--they warm the gentle, inspire the noble, and<br>\r\n",
      "awake the daring that lies unmoved until it be called into action<br>\r\n",
      "for the rescue of those for whom our affections have taken life.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Things had arrived at that particular point where law-lovers-we mean<br>\r\n",
      "lawyers-look on with happy consciences and pleasing expectations;<br>\r\n",
      "that is, they had arrived at that certain hinge of slave law the<br>\r\n",
      "turn of which sends men, women, and children, into the vortex of<br>\r\n",
      "slavery, where their hopes are for ever crushed. One day Marston had<br>\r\n",
      "strong hopes of saving them; but his hopes vanished on the next. The<br>\r\n",
      "fair creature, by him made a wretch, seemed before him, on her<br>\r\n",

      "child. The very thought would have doubly nerved him to action; and<br>\r\n",
      "yet, what mattered such action against the force of slavery<br>\r\n",
      "injustice? All his exertions, all his pleadings, all his<br>\r\n",
      "protestations, in a land where liberty boasts its greatness, would<br>\r\n",

      "that he can't make anything straight of it-except that there is<br>\r\n",
      "something very alarming.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "She has been carried to one of the ante-chambers, reclines on a<br>\r\n",
      "couch of softest tapestry, a physician at one side, and Alice,<br>\r\n",
      "bathing her temples with aromatic liquid, on the other. She presents<br>\r\n",

      "lose,--a carriage is ordered, the colonel drives to the prison, and<br>\r\n",
      "there finds the object of Franconia's trouble. She, the two children<br>\r\n",

      "slave power fears itself, its tyranny glares forth in the emaciated<br>\r\n",

      "walls. His tap on the door startles her; she moves from her<br>\r\n",
      "position, where she had been seated on a coarse blanket. It is all<br>\r\n",
      "they (the hospitable southern world, with its generous laws) can<br>\r\n",
      "afford her; she makes it a bed for three. A people less boastful of<br>\r\n",

      "the skirts of her dress,--buries her face in her bosom, retires a few<br>\r\n",
      "steps, and again seats herself on the blanket.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"The question is pending. If I'm right about it-and I believe I'm<br>\r\n",
      "generally so on such cases-it comes on before the next session, fall<br>\r\n",
      "term,\" says the gaoler, turning to M'Carstrow with a look of<br>\r\n",
      "wonderful importance. The gaoler, who, with his keys, lets loose the<br>\r\n",
      "anxieties of men, continues his learned remarks. \"Notice has been<br>\r\n",
      "served how she's free. But that kind o' twisting things to make<br>\r\n",
      "slave property free never amounts to much, especially when a man<br>\r\n",
      "gets where they say Marston is! Anthony Romescos has been quizzing<br>\r\n",
      "about, and it don't take much to make such things property when he's<br>\r\n",
      "round.\" The man of keys again looks very wise, runs his hand deep<br>\r\n",
      "into the pocket of his coat, and says something about this being a<br>\r\n",
      "great country.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"How much do you reckon her worth, my friend?\" enquires M'Carstrow,<br>\r\n",
      "exchanging a significant glance.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well, now you've got me. It's a point of judgment, you see. The<br>\r\n",
      "article's rather questionable-been spoiled. There's a doubt about<br>\r\n",
      "such property when you put it up, except a gentleman wants it; and<br>\r\n",
      "then, I reckon, it'll bring a smart price. There's this to be<br>\r\n",
      "considered, I reckon, though they haven't set a price on her yet,<br>\r\n",
      "she's excellent good looking; and the young un's a perfect cherry.<br>\r\n",
      "It'll bring a big heap one of these days.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We won't mind that, just now, gaoler,\" M'Carstrow says, very<br>\r\n",
      "complacently; \"you'll let me have her tonight, and I'll return her<br>\r\n",
      "safe in the morning.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No, no,\" interposes Clotilda, mistaking M'Carstrow's object. She<br>\r\n",
      "crouches down on the blanket, as if shrinking from a deadly assault:<br>\r\n",
      "\"let me remain, even in my cell.\" She draws the children to her<br>\r\n",
      "side.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Don't mistake me, my girl: I am a friend. I want you for Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "Rovero. She is fond of you, you know.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Franconia!\" she exclaims with joy, starting to her feet at the<br>\r\n",
      "sound of the name. \"I do know her, dear Franconia! I know her, I<br>\r\n",
      "love her, she loves me-I wish she was my mother. But she is to be<br>\r\n",
      "the angel of my freedom-\" Here she suddenly stopped, as if she had<br>\r\n",
      "betrayed something.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We must lose no time,\" M'Carstrow says, informing her that<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia is that night to be his bride, and cannot be happy without<br>\r\n",
      "seeing her.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Bride! and cannot prepare without me,\" mutters the woman, seeming<br>\r\n",
      "to doubt the reality of his statement. A thought flashes in her<br>\r\n",
      "mind: \"Franconia has not forgotten me; I will go and be Franconia's<br>\r\n",
      "friend.\" And with a child-like simplicity she takes Annette by the<br>\r\n",
      "hand, as if they were inseparable. \"Can't Nicholas go, too?\" she<br>\r\n",
      "inquires.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You must leave the child,\" is the cool reply. M'Carstrow attempts<br>\r\n",
      "to draw the heavy bolt that fastens the door.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not so fast, if you please,\" the warden speaks. \"I cannot permit<br>\r\n",
      "her to leave without an order from the sheriff.\" He puts his hand<br>\r\n",
      "against the door.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"She will surely be returned in the morning; I'm good for a hundred<br>\r\n",
      "such pieces of property.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Can't help that,\" interrupts the gaoler, coolly.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"But, there's my honour!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"An article gaolers better not deal in. It may be very good<br>\r\n",
      "commodity in some kinds of business-don't pay in ours; and then,<br>\r\n",
      "when this kind of property is in question, it won't do to show a<br>\r\n",
      "favour beyond the rule.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow is in a sad dilemma. He must relieve himself through a<br>\r\n",
      "problem of law, which, at this late hour, brings matters to a<br>\r\n",
      "singular point. He believes Franconia suffers from a nervous<br>\r\n",
      "affection, as the doctors call it, and has fixed her mind upon the<br>\r\n",
      "only object of relief. He had made no preparation for such a<br>\r\n",
      "critical event; but there is no postponing the ceremony,--no<br>\r\n",
      "depriving her of the indulgence. Not a moment is to be lost: he sets<br>\r\n",
      "off, post-haste, for the sheriff's office. That functionary is well<br>\r\n",
      "known for his crude method of executing business; to ask a favour of<br>\r\n",
      "him would be like asking the sea to give up its dead. He is cold,<br>\r\n",
      "methodical, unmoveable; very much opposed to anything having the<br>\r\n",
      "appearance of an innovation upon his square rules of business.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow finds him in just the mood to interpose all the frigid<br>\r\n",
      "peculiarities of his incomprehensible nature. The colonel has known<br>\r\n",
      "him by reputation; he knows him now through a different medium.<br>\r\n",
      "After listening to M'Carstrow's request, and comporting himself with<br>\r\n",
      "all imaginable dignity, he runs his fingers through his hair, looks<br>\r\n",
      "at M'Carstrow vacantly, and well nigh rouses his temper. M'Carstrow<br>\r\n",
      "feels, as southern gentlemen are wont to feel, that his position and<br>\r\n",
      "title are enough to ensure courtesy and a quick response. The man of<br>\r\n",
      "writs and summonses feels quite sure that the pomp of his office is<br>\r\n",
      "sufficient to offset all other distinctions.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Whar' d'ye say the gal was,--in my gaol?\" the sheriff inquires, with<br>\r\n",
      "solemn earnestness, and drawling his words measuredly, as if the<br>\r\n",
      "whole affair was quite within his line of business. The sheriff has<br>\r\n",
      "the opportunity of making a nice little thing of it; the object to<br>\r\n",
      "be released will serve the profits of the profession. \"Gittin' that<br>\r\n",
      "gal out yander ain't an easy thing now, 'taint! It'll cost ye 'bout<br>\r\n",
      "twenty dollars, sartin,\" he adds, turning over the leaves of his big<br>\r\n",
      "book, and running his finger down a scale of names.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I don't care if it costs a hundred! Give me an order for her<br>\r\n",
      "release!\" M'Carstrow begins to understand Mr. Sheriff's composition,<br>\r\n",
      "and putting his hand into his pocket, draws forth a dwenty-dollar<br>\r\n",
      "gold piece, throws it upon the table. The effect is electric: it<br>\r\n",
      "smooths down the surface of Mr. Sheriff's nature,--brings out the<br>\r\n",
      "disposition to accommodate. The Sheriff's politeness now taxes<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow's power to reciprocate.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, ye see, my friend,\" says Mr. Sheriff, in a quaint tone,<br>\r\n",
      "\"there's three fi fas on that critter. Hold a minute!\" He must needs<br>\r\n",
      "take a better glance; he runs his fingers over the page again,<br>\r\n",
      "mutters to himself, and then breaks out into a half-musical,<br>\r\n",
      "half-undefinable humming. \"It's a snarled-up affair, the whole on't.<br>\r\n",
      "T'll take a plaguy cunnin' lawyer to take the shine out.\" The<br>\r\n",
      "sheriff pushes the piece of coin nearer the inkstand, into the<br>\r\n",
      "centre of the table. \"I feel all over like accommodatin' ye,\" he<br>\r\n",
      "deigns to say; \"but then t'll be so pestky crooked gettin' the thing<br>\r\n",
      "straight.\" He hesitates before the wonderful difficulty,--he can't<br>\r\n",
      "see his way straight through it. \"Three fi fas! I believe I'm<br>\r\n",
      "correct; there's one principal one, however.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I pledge my honour for her return in the morning; and she shall be<br>\r\n",
      "all shined up with a new dress. Her presence is imperatively<br>\r\n",
      "necessary to-night,\" M'Carstrow remarks, becoming impatient.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Two fi fas!-well, the first look looked like three. But, the<br>\r\n",
      "principal one out of the way,--no matter.\" Mr. Sheriff becomes more<br>\r\n",
      "and more enlightened on the unenlightened difficulties of the law.<br>\r\n",
      "He remarks, touching M'Carstrow on the arm, with great seriousness<br>\r\n",
      "of countenance, \"I sees how the knot's tied. Ye know, my functions<br>\r\n",
      "are turned t' most everything; and it makes a body see through a<br>\r\n",
      "thing just as straight as--. Pest on't! Ye see, it's mighty likely<br>\r\n",
      "property,--don't strike such every day. That gal 'll bring a big tick<br>\r\n",
      "in the market-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Excuse me, my dear sir,\" M'Carstrow suddenly interrupts.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Understand me, if you please. I want her for nothing that you<br>\r\n",
      "contemplate,--nothing, I pledge you my honour as a southern<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"'Ah,--bless me! Well, but there's nothin' in that. I see! I see! I<br>\r\n",
      "see!\" Mr. Sheriff brightens up, his very soul seems to expand with<br>\r\n",
      "legal tenacity. \"Well, ye see, there's a question of property raised<br>\r\n",
      "about the gal, and her young 'un, too-nice young 'un 'tis; but it's<br>\r\n",
      "mighty easy tellin' whose it is. About the law matter, though, you<br>\r\n",
      "must get the consent of all the plaintiff's attorneys,--that's no<br>\r\n",
      "small job. Lawyers are devilish slippery, rough a feller amazingly,<br>\r\n",
      "once in a while; chance if ye don't have to get the critter valued<br>\r\n",
      "by a survey. Graspum, though's ollers on hand, is first best good at<br>\r\n",
      "that: can say her top price while ye'd say seven,\" says Mr. Sheriff,<br>\r\n",
      "maintaining his wise dignity, as he reminds M'Carstrow that his name<br>\r\n",
      "is Cur, commonly called Mr. Cur, sheriff of the county. It must not<br>\r\n",
      "be inferred that Mr. Cur has any of the canine qualities about him.<br>\r\n",
      "The hour for the ceremony is close at hand. M'Carstrow, satisfied<br>\r\n",
      "that rules of law are very arbitrary things in the hands of<br>\r\n",
      "officials-that such property is difficult to get out of the meshes<br>\r\n",
      "of legal technicality-that honour is neither marketable or<br>\r\n",
      "pledgeable in such cases, must move quickly: he seeks the very<br>\r\n",
      "conscientious attorneys, gets them together, pleads the necessity of<br>\r\n",
      "the case: a convention is arranged, Graspum will value the<br>\r\n",
      "property-as a weigher and gauger of human flesh. This done,<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow signs a bond in the sum of fifteen hundred dollars,<br>\r\n",
      "making himself responsible for the property. The instrument contains<br>\r\n",
      "a provision, that should any unforeseen disaster befall it, the<br>\r\n",
      "question of property will remain subject to the decision of Court.<br>\r\n",
      "Upon these conditions, M'Carstrow procures an order for her release.<br>\r\n",
      "He is careful, however, that nothing herein set forth shall affect<br>\r\n",
      "the suit already instituted.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Love is an exhilarating medicine, moving and quickening the hearts<br>\r\n",
      "of old and young. M'Carstrow felt its influence sensibly, as he<br>\r\n",
      "hurried back to the prison-excited by the near approach of the<br>\r\n",
      "ceremony-with the all-important order. Bolts, bars, and malarious<br>\r\n",
      "walls, yield to it the pining captive whose presence will soothe<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia's feelings.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Clotilda was no less elated at the hope of changing her prison for<br>\r\n",
      "the presence of her young mistress; and yet, the previous summons<br>\r\n",
      "had nearly unnerved her. She lingers at the grating, waiting<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow's return. Time seems to linger, until her feelings are<br>\r\n",
      "nearly overwhelmed in suspense. Again, there is a mystery in the<br>\r\n",
      "mission of the stranger; she almost doubts his sincerity. It may be<br>\r\n",
      "one of those plots, so often laid by slave-traders, to separate her<br>\r\n",
      "from her child,--perhaps to run her where all hope of regaining<br>\r\n",
      "freedom will be for ever lost. One after another did these things<br>\r\n",
      "recur to her mind, only to make the burden of her troubles more<br>\r\n",
      "painful.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Her child has eaten its crust, fallen into a deep sleep, and, its<br>\r\n",
      "little hands resting clasped on its bosom, lies calmly upon the<br>\r\n",
      "coarse blanket. She gazes upon it, as a mother only can gaze. There<br>\r\n",
      "is beauty in that sweet face; it is not valued for its loveliness,<br>\r\n",
      "its tenderness, its purity. How cursed that it is to be the prime<br>\r\n",
      "object of her disgrace! Thus contemplating, M'Carstrow appears at<br>\r\n",
      "the outer gate, is admitted into the prison, reaches the inner<br>\r\n",
      "grating, is received by the warden, who smiles generously. \"I'm as<br>\r\n",
      "glad as anything! Hope you had a good time with his honour, Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Cur?\" he says, holding the big key in his hand, and leading the way<br>\r\n",
      "into the office. He takes his seat at a table, commences preparing<br>\r\n",
      "the big book. \"Here is the entry,\" he says, with a smile of<br>\r\n",
      "satisfaction. \"We'll soon straighten the thing now.\" Puts out his<br>\r\n",
      "hand for the order which M'Carstrow has been holding. \"That's just<br>\r\n",
      "the little thing,\" he says, reading it word by word carefully, and<br>\r\n",
      "concluding with the remark that he has had a deal of trouble with<br>\r\n",
      "it. M'Carstrow places some pieces of silver in his hand; they turn<br>\r\n",
      "the man of keys into a subservient creature. He hastens to the cell,<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow following,--draws the heavy bolts,--bids the prisoner come<br>\r\n",
      "forth. \"Yes, come, girl; I've had a tough time to get you out of<br>\r\n",
      "that place: it holds its prey like lawyers' seals,\" rejoins<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not without my child?\" she inquires quickly. She stoops down and<br>\r\n",
      "kisses it. \"My daughter,--my sweet child!\" she mutters.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Till to-morrow. You must leave her for to-night.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"If I must!\" Again she kisses the child, adding, as she smoothed her<br>\r\n",
      "hand over Annette, and parted her hair, \"Mother will return soon.\"<br>\r\n",
      "There was something so touching in the word mother, spoken while<br>\r\n",
      "leaning over a sleeping babe. Clotilda reaches the door, having kept<br>\r\n",
      "her eyes upon the child as she left her behind. A tremor comes over<br>\r\n",
      "her,--she reluctantly passes the threshold of the narrow arch; but<br>\r\n",
      "she breathes the fresh air of heaven,--feels as if her life had been<br>\r\n",
      "renewed. A mother's thoughts, a mother's anxieties, a mother's love,<br>\r\n",
      "veil her countenance. She turns to take a last look as the cold door<br>\r\n",
      "closes upon the dearest object of her life. How it grates upon its<br>\r\n",
      "hinges! her hopes seem for ever extinguished.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The law is thus far satisfied-the legal gentlemen are satisfied, the<br>\r\n",
      "warden is not the least generous; and Mr. Cur feels that, while the<br>\r\n",
      "job was a very nice one, he has not transcended one jot of his<br>\r\n",
      "importance. Such is highly gratifying to all parties. Clotilda is<br>\r\n",
      "hurried into a carriage, driven at a rapid rate, and soon arrives at<br>\r\n",
      "the mansion. Here she is ushered into a chamber, arrayed in a new<br>\r\n",
      "dress, and conducted into the presence of Franconia. The meeting may<br>\r\n",
      "be more easily imagined than described. Their congratulations were<br>\r\n",
      "warm, affectionate, touching. Clotilda kisses Franconia's hand again<br>\r\n",
      "and again; Franconia, in turn, lays her hand upon Clotilda's<br>\r\n",
      "shoulder, and, with a look of commiseration, sets her eyes intently<br>\r\n",
      "upon her, as if she detects in her countenance those features she<br>\r\n",
      "cannot disown. She requests to be left alone with Clotilda for a<br>\r\n",
      "short time. Her friends withdraw. She discloses the difficulties<br>\r\n",
      "into which the family have suddenly fallen, the plan of escape she<br>\r\n",
      "has arranged, the hopes she entertains of her regaining her freedom.<br>\r\n",

      "minutes more, and the little craft moves seaward under the pressure<br>\r\n",
      "of a gentle breeze. There is no tragic pursuit of slave-hunters, no<br>\r\n",

      "its workings upon the black man, but upon the lineal offspring of<br>\r\n",
      "freemen-and has resolved to work against its mighty arm. With him it<br>\r\n",

      "God's own, man cannot pollute them; they are like a picture of glory<br>\r\n",
      "inspiring her with emotions she cannot suppress. As the last dim<br>\r\n",

      "Bacchanalians,--men who pay court to appease the wondrous discontent<br>\r\n",
      "of the belly, to the total neglect of the back. Not a few swore, by<br>\r\n",
      "all their importance, a greater man never lived. He is, indeed, all<br>\r\n",
      "that can be desired to please the simple pretensions of a<br>\r\n",
      "free-thinking and free-acting southern people, who, having elevated<br>\r\n",

      "still retain the bad left them by their English ancestry, having<br>\r\n",
      "long since forgotten the good, do sneer now and then at Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Brodereque's pretensions. But, like all great men who have a great<br>\r\n",

      "the perpetrators of such aristocratic sneers what a spare few they<br>\r\n",
      "are. He asserts, and with more truth than poetry, that any gentleman<br>\r\n",

      "while inciting their vanity; and, at the same time, always secure a<br>\r\n",
      "good opinion for themselves. And, too, he was liberally inclined,<br>\r\n",
      "never refused tick, but always made it tell; by which well-devised<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Always civil, and even obsequious at first, ready to condescend and<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "It is dark,--night has stolen upon us again,--the hour for the raffle<br>\r\n",
      "is at hand. The saloon, about a hundred and forty feet long by forty<br>\r\n",
      "wide, is brilliantly lighted for the occasion. The gas-lights throw<br>\r\n",
      "strange shadows upon the distemper painting with which the walls are<br>\r\n",

      "paintings of battle scenes and heroic devices, alternated with<br>\r\n",
      "lithographic and badly-executed engravings of lustfully-exposed<br>\r\n",
      "females. Soon the saloon fills with a throng of variously-mixed<br>\r\n",

      "fashionable world, are present. Some affect the fast young man;<br>\r\n",
      "others seem mere speculators, attracted to the place for the purpose<br>\r\n",
      "of enjoying an hour, seeing the sight, and, it may be, taking a<br>\r\n",
      "throw for the \"gal.\" The crowd presents a singular contrast of<br>\r\n",
      "beings. Some are dressed to the very extreme of fantastic fashion,<br>\r\n",
      "and would seem to have wasted their brains in devising colours for<br>\r\n",
      "their backs; others, aspiring to the seriously genteel, are<br>\r\n",
      "fashioned in very extravagant broadcloth; while a third group is<br>\r\n",
      "dressed in most niggardly attire, which sets very loosely. In<br>\r\n",
      "addition to this they wear very large black, white, and<br>\r\n",
      "grey-coloured felt hats, slouched over their heads; while their<br>\r\n",
      "nether garments, of red and brown linsey-woolsey, fit like<br>\r\n",
      "Falstaff's doublet on a whip stock. They seem proud of the grim<br>\r\n",
      "tufts of hair that, like the moss-grown clumps upon an old oak,<br>\r\n",
      "spread over their faces; and they move about in the grotesque crowd,<br>\r\n",
      "making their physiognomies increase its piquancy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The saloon is one of those places at the south where great men,<br>\r\n",
      "small men, men of different spheres and occupations, men in<br>\r\n",
      "prominently defined positions, men in doubtful calls of life, and<br>\r\n",
      "men most disreputably employed, most do congregate. At one end of<br>\r\n",
      "the saloon is a large oyster counter, behind which stand two<br>\r\n",
      "coloured men, with sauces, savories, and other mixtures at hand,<br>\r\n",
      "ready to serve customers who prefer the delicacy in its raw state.<br>\r\n",
      "Men are partaking without noting numbers. Mr. O'Brodereque has boys<br>\r\n",
      "serving who take very good care of the numbers. Extending along one<br>\r\n",
      "side of the saloon is an elaborately carved mahogany counter, with<br>\r\n",
      "panels of French white and gilt mouldings. This is surmounted with a<br>\r\n",
      "marble slab, upon which stand well-filled decanters, vases, and<br>\r\n",
      "salvers. Behind this counter, genteelly-dressed and polite<br>\r\n",
      "attendants are serving customers who stand along its side in a line,<br>\r\n",
      "treating in true southern style. The calling for drinks is a problem<br>\r\n",
      "for nice ears to solve, so varied are the sounds, so strange the<br>\r\n",
      "names: style, quantity, and mixture seemed without limit, set on in<br>\r\n",
      "various colours to flow and flood the spirits of the jovial. On the<br>\r\n",
      "opposite side of the saloon are rows of seats and arm-chairs,<br>\r\n",
      "interspersed with small tables, from which the beverage can be<br>\r\n",
      "imbibed more at ease. On the second story is the great \"eating<br>\r\n",
      "saloon,\" with its various apartments, its curtained boxes, its<br>\r\n",
      "prim-looking waiters, its pier-glass walls. There is every<br>\r\n",

      "points a finger recognisingly at a wag in the corner, who has<br>\r\n",

      "smiling, and acknowledging the compliments of his generous customers<br>\r\n",
      "with prodigious grace, he merely announces to his friends--with<br>\r\n",
      "eloquence that defies imitation, and turns rhetoric into a<br>\r\n",
      "discordant exposition of his own important self--that, not having<br>\r\n",

      "thick, black, undulating tresses over her neck and shoulders. A few<br>\r\n",
      "moments more, and she resumes a calm appearance, looks resolutely<br>\r\n",
      "upon her auditors, with indignation and contempt pictured in her<br>\r\n",
      "countenance.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"She'll soon get over that!\" ejaculates another bystander, as he<br>\r\n",
      "smooths the long beard on his haggard face. \"Strip her down!\" The<br>\r\n",
      "request is no sooner made, than Mr. O'Brodereque mounts the stand to<br>\r\n",
      "perform the feat. \"Great country this, gentlemen!\" he speaks, taking<br>\r\n",
      "her by the shoulders.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"All off! all off, general!\" is the popular demand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The sensitive nature of the innocent girl recoils; she cringes from<br>\r\n",
      "his touch; she shudders, and vainly attempts to resist. She must<br>\r\n",
      "yield; the demand is imperative. Her dress falls at Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "O'Brodereque's touch. She stands before the gazing crowd, exposed to<br>\r\n",
      "the very thighs, holding the loose folds of her dress in her hands.<br>\r\n",
      "There is no sympathy for those moistened eyes; oh, no! it is a<br>\r\n",
      "luscious feast-puritans have no part in the sin-for those who, in<br>\r\n",
      "our land of love and liberty, buy and sell poor human nature, and<br>\r\n",
      "make it food for serving hell.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Naked she stands for minutes; the assembled gentlemen have feasted<br>\r\n",
      "their eyes,--good men have played the part of their good natures.<br>\r\n",
      "General O'Brodereque, conscious of his dignity, orders her to be<br>\r\n",
      "taken down. The waiter performs the duty, and she is led out midst<br>\r\n",
      "the acclamations and plaudits of the crowd, who call for the raffle.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. O'Brodereque hopes gentlemen are satisfied with what they have<br>\r\n",
      "seen, and will pledge his honour that the pony and dog are quite as<br>\r\n",
      "sound and healthy as the wench whose portions they have had a chance<br>\r\n",
      "to shy; and for which-the extra sight-they should pay an extra<br>\r\n",
      "treat. This, however, his generosity will not allow him to stand<br>\r\n",
      "upon; and, seeing how time is precious, and the weather warm, he<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "As the general concludes this very significant invitation, Dan<br>\r\n",
      "Bengal, Anthony Romescos, and Nath Nimrod, enter together. Their<br>\r\n",
      "presence creates some little commotion, for Romescos is known to be<br>\r\n",
      "turbulent, and very uncertain when liquor flows freely, which is the<br>\r\n",
      "case at present.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I say, general!-old hoss! I takes all the chances what's left,\"<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos shouts at the top of his voice. His eyes glare with<br>\r\n",
      "anxiety,--his red, savage face, doubly sun-scorched, glows out as he<br>\r\n",
      "elbows his way through the crowd up to the desk, where sits a<br>\r\n",
      "corpulent clerk. \"Beg your pardon, gentlemen: not so fast, if you<br>\r\n",
      "please!\" he says, entering names in his ledger, receiving money,<br>\r\n",
      "\"doing the polite of the establishment.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos's coat and nether clothing are torn in several places, a<br>\r\n",
      "hunting-belt girdles his waist; a bowie-knife (Sheffield make)<br>\r\n",
      "protrudes from his breast-pocket, his hair hangs in jagged tufts<br>\r\n",
      "over the collar of his coat, which, with the rough moccasons on his<br>\r\n",
      "feet, give him an air of fierce desperaton and recklessness. His<br>\r\n",
      "presence is evidently viewed with suspicion; he is a curious object<br>\r\n",
      "which the crowd are willing to give ample space to.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No, you don't take 'em all, neither!\" says another, in a defiant<br>\r\n",
      "tone. The remaining \"chances\" are at once put up for sale; they<br>\r\n",
      "bring premiums, as one by one they are knocked down to the highest<br>\r\n",
      "bidders, some as much as fifty per cent. advance. Gentlemen are not<br>\r\n",
      "to know it, because Mr. O'Brodereque thinks his honour above<br>\r\n",
      "everything else; but the fact is, there is a collusion between<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos and the honourable Mr. O'Brodereque. The former is playing<br>\r\n",
      "his part to create a rivalry that will put dollars and cents into<br>\r\n",
      "the pocket of the latter.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well!\" exclaims Romescos, with great indifference, as soon as the<br>\r\n",
      "sale had concluded, \"I've got seven throws, all lucky ones. I'll<br>\r\n",
      "take any man's bet for two hundred dollars that I gets the gal<br>\r\n",
      "prize.\" Nobody seems inclined to accept the challenge. A table is<br>\r\n",
      "set in the centre of the saloon, the dice are brought on, amidst a<br>\r\n",
      "jargon of noise and confusion; to this is added drinking, smoking,<br>\r\n",
      "swearing, and all kinds of small betting.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The raffle commences; one by one the numbers are called. Romescos'<br>\r\n",
      "turn has come; all eyes are intently set upon him. He is celebrated<br>\r\n",
      "for tricks of his trade; he seldom repudiates the character, and<br>\r\n",
      "oftener prides in the name of a shrewd one, who can command a prize<br>\r\n",
      "for his sharp dealing. In a word, he has a peculiar faculty of<br>\r\n",
      "shielding the doubtful transactions of a class of men no less<br>\r\n",
      "dishonest, but more modest in point of reputation.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos spreads himself wonderfully, throws his dice, and exults<br>\r\n",
      "over the result. He has turned up three sixes at the first and<br>\r\n",
      "second throws, and two sixes and five at the third.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Beat that! who can?\" he says. No one discovers that he has, by a<br>\r\n",
      "very dexterous movement, slipped a set of false dice into the box,<br>\r\n",
      "while O'Brodereque diverted attention at the moment by introducing<br>\r\n",
      "the pony into the saloon.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "We will pass over many things that occurred, and inform the reader<br>\r\n",
      "that Romescos won the first prize-the woman. The dog and pony prizes<br>\r\n",
      "were carried off by legitimate winners. This specific part of the<br>\r\n",
      "scene over, a band of negro minstrels are introduced, who strike up<br>\r\n",
      "their happy glees, the music giving new life to the revelry. Such a<br>\r\n",
      "medley of drinking, gambling, and carousing followed, as defies<br>\r\n",
      "description. What a happy thing it is to be free; they feel this,--it<br>\r\n",
      "it is a happy feeling! The sport lasts till the small hours of<br>\r\n",
      "morning advance. Romescos is seen leaving the saloon very quietly.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There!\" says Mr. O'Brodereque exultingly, \"he hasn't got so much of<br>\r\n",
      "a showing. That nigger gal ain't what she's cracked up to be!\" and<br>\r\n",
      "he shakes his head knowingly, thrusts his hands deep into his<br>\r\n",

      "many legal gesticulations with his finger; he, however, disclaims<br>\r\n",
      "all and every connection with the legal body, inasmuch as its<br>\r\n",
      "members have sunk very much in the scale of character, and will<br>\r\n",
      "require a deal of purifying ere he can call them brothers; but he<br>\r\n",
      "knows a thing or two of constitutional law, and thus proceeds:<br>\r\n",

      "all right. You only want to prove that Marston bought her, that's<br>\r\n",
      "all! As for the young scraps, why--supposing they are his-that won't<br>\r\n",
      "make a bit of difference; they are property for all that, subject to<br>\r\n",
      "legal restraints. Your claim will be valid against it. You may have<br>\r\n",
      "to play nicely over some intricate legal points. But, remember,<br>\r\n",
      "nigger law is wonderfully elastic; it requires superhuman wisdom to<br>\r\n",
      "unravel its social and political intricacies, and when I view it<br>\r\n",
      "through the horoscope of an indefinite future it makes my very head<br>\r\n",

      "traverse the case until such time as you can procure reliable proof<br>\r\n",
      "to convict.\" Mr. Scranton asserts this as the force of his legal and<br>\r\n",
      "constitutional acumen. He addresses himself to a mercantile-looking<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman who sits at the opposite side of the table, attentively<br>\r\n",
      "listening. He is one of several of Marston's creditors, who sit at<br>\r\n",
      "the table; they have attached certain property, and having some<br>\r\n",
      "doubts of overthrowing Marston's plea of freedom, which he has<br>\r\n",
      "intimated his intention to enter, have called in the valuable aid of<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos. That indomitable individual, however, has more interests<br>\r\n",
      "than one to serve, and is playing his cards with great \"diplomatic<br>\r\n",
      "skill.\" Indeed, he often remarks that his wonderful diplomatic skill<br>\r\n",
      "would have been a great acquisition to the federal government,<br>\r\n",
      "inasmuch as it would have facilitated all its Southern American<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The point in question at present, and which they must get over, in<br>\r\n",
      "order to prove the property, is made more difficult by the doubt in<br>\r\n",
      "which the origin of Clotilda has always been involved. Many are the<br>\r\n",

      "can positively assert where she came from; in a word, no one dare!<br>\r\n",

      "interpolation, reminds his friends that, seeing many of his very<br>\r\n",
      "best customers present, he expects sharp and healthy bids. He will<br>\r\n",
      "further remind them (smiling and fretting his hands, as if to show<br>\r\n",
      "the number of diamond rings he can afford to wear), that the<br>\r\n",
      "property has been well raised, is well known, and ranges from the<br>\r\n",
      "brightest and most interesting, to the commonest black field hand.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, gentlemen,\" he adds, \"by the fortune of this unfortunate sale<br>\r\n",

      "We can sell you a Church and a preacher-a dance-house and a<br>\r\n",
      "fiddler-a cook and an oyster-shop. Anything! All sold for no fault;<br>\r\n",
      "and warranted as sound as a roach. The honourable sheriff will gives<br>\r\n",
      "titles-that functionary being present signifies his willingness-and<br>\r\n",
      "every man purchasing is expected to have his shiners ready, so that<br>\r\n",
      "he can plunk down cash in ten days. I need not recount the<br>\r\n",
      "circumstances under which this property is offered for sale; it is<br>\r\n",
      "enough to say that it is offered; but, let me say, gentlemen, to<br>\r\n",
      "enlarge upon it would be painful to my feelings. I will merely read<br>\r\n",
      "the schedule, and, after selling the people, put up the oxen, mules,<br>\r\n",
      "and farming utensils.\" Mr. Forshou, with easy contentment, takes up<br>\r\n",
      "the list and reads at the top of his voice. The names of heads of<br>\r\n",
      "families are announced one by one; they answer the call promptly. He<br>\r\n",
      "continues till he reaches Annette and Nicholas, and here he pauses<br>\r\n",
      "for a few moments, turning from the paper to them, as if he one<br>\r\n",
      "minute saw them on the paper and the next on the floor. \"Here,<br>\r\n",
      "gentlemen,\" he ejaculates, in a half guttural voice-something he<br>\r\n",
      "could not account for touched his conscience at the moment-holding<br>\r\n",
      "the paper nearer his eye-glass, \"there is two bits of property<br>\r\n",

      "sell. It makes a feller's heart feel as if it warn't stuck in the<br>\r\n",
      "right place.\" Mr. Forshou casts another irresistible look at the<br>\r\n",
      "children; his countenance changes; he says he is very sensitive, and<br>\r\n",
      "shows it in his blushes. He might have saved his blushes for the<br>\r\n",
      "benefit of the State. The State is careful of its blushes; it has<br>\r\n",
      "none to sell-none to bestow on a child's sorrow!<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",

      "and will speak for the vender, who is less accustomed to speaking<br>\r\n",
      "for himself. \"Feelings bring up recollections of things one never<br>\r\n",

      "\"Get down, old woman.\" Rachel moves to the steps, and is received by<br>\r\n",

      "sure that his newly-purchased property will \"stay put.\" He turns<br>\r\n",
      "about suddenly, approaches Rachel-crouched in a corner-mumbling over<br>\r\n",
      "some incomprehensible jargon, evidently very much disturbed in her<br>\r\n",
      "feelings, saying, \"I kind a' think I see devil in yer eye, old<br>\r\n",
      "woman.\" Rachel turns her head aside, but makes no answer. Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Romescos will make everything certain; so, drawing a cord, similar<br>\r\n",

      "betrayed the philosophy of profound democracy,--is a preacher, and,<br>\r\n",
      "by the value of his theological capacity, attracts more than<br>\r\n",
      "ordinary attention. But his life has been a failure,--a mere<br>\r\n",
      "experiment in divinity struggling with the sensitive power of model<br>\r\n",
      "democracy. He now seems impatient to know that doom to which the<br>\r\n",
      "freedom of an enlightened age has consigned him. One minute some<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Harry has feelings, and is strongly inclined to cling to the opinion<br>\r\n",

      "simple requests to make, which his black sense might have told him<br>\r\n",
      "the democracy could not grant. He requests (referring to his<br>\r\n",

      "vender-will sell him with his poor old woman, and that he do not<br>\r\n",
      "separate him from his dear children. In support of his appeal he<br>\r\n",
      "sets forth, in language that would be impressive were it from white<br>\r\n",

      "hand so feared and yet so harmless), and affectionately places it on<br>\r\n",
      "the head of his youngest child; then, taking it up, he places it in<br>\r\n",
      "the arms of his wife,--perhaps not long to be so,--who stands<br>\r\n",
      "trembling and sobbing at his side. Behold how picturesque is the<br>\r\n",
      "fruit of democracy! Three small children, clinging round the skirts<br>\r\n",
      "of a mother's garment, casting sly peeps at purchasers as if they<br>\r\n",
      "had an instinctive knowledge of their fate. They must be sold for<br>\r\n",

      "labour for a better cause; we will leave them valiant defenders of<br>\r\n",
      "southern chivalry, southern generosity, southern affability, and<br>\r\n",
      "southern injustice. To be offended at so small an affair as selling<br>\r\n",
      "a brother clergyman,--to make the insinuation that they are not<br>\r\n",

      "understand. The devil is doing battle with his heart-a heart bound<br>\r\n",

      "\"Don' talk so, good gal; ye don' know dis old man,--so hungry,--most<br>\r\n",

      "bounds down the stairs, and to the door, grasps the old man's hand,<br>\r\n",
      "as a fond child warmly grasps the hand of a parent, and welcomes him<br>\r\n",

      "room on the left hand of the hall, where, after ordering some supper<br>\r\n",
      "for him, she begs he will tell her all about his wayfaring. It is<br>\r\n",

      "supper, rests his elbow on the table and his head in his hand, and<br>\r\n",
      "commences disclosing his troubles to Franconia. He tells her how he<br>\r\n",
      "secreted himself in the pine-woods,--how he wandered through swamps,<br>\r\n",
      "waded creeks, slept on trunks of trees, crept stealthily to the old<br>\r\n",
      "mansion at night, listened for mas'r's footsteps, and watched<br>\r\n",
      "beneath the veranda; and when he found he was not there, how he<br>\r\n",
      "turned and left the spot, his poor heart regretting. How his heart<br>\r\n",

      "if they found out who owned you, and put you up at auction<br>\r\n",
      "to-morrow,\" she says, with seeming unconsciousness. She little knew<br>\r\n",
      "how much the old man prided in his value,--how much he esteemed the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "There, seated in an arm-chair, she waits, and waits, and waits, hope<br>\r\n",
      "and anxiety recording time as it passes. The servant has seen Daddy<br>\r\n",
      "safe in his room, and joins her missus, where, by the force of<br>\r\n",
      "habit, she coils herself at her feet, and sleeps. She has not long<br>\r\n",
      "remained in this position when loud singing breaks upon her ear;<br>\r\n",
      "louder and louder it vibrates through the music of the storm, and<br>\r\n",
      "approaches. Now she distinctly recognises the sharp voice of<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow, which is followed by loud rappings at the door of the<br>\r\n",
      "basement hall. M'Carstrow, impatiently, demands entrance. The<br>\r\n",
      "half-sleeping servant, startled at the noise, springs to her feet,<br>\r\n",
      "rubs her eyes, bounds down the stairs, seizes the globular lamp, and<br>\r\n",
      "proceeds to open the door. Franconia, a candle in her hand, waits at<br>\r\n",

      "perpendicular, he staggers a few yards-the girl screaming with<br>\r\n",
      "fright-and groans as his face again confronts the tiles. To make the<br>\r\n",
      "matter still worse, three of his boon companions follow him, and,<br>\r\n",
      "almost in succession, pay their penance to the floor, in an<br>\r\n",
      "indescribable catacomb.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I tell you what, Colonel! if that nigger gal a' yourn don't stand<br>\r\n",

      "endeavouring to extricate himself and regain his upright. After<br>\r\n",
      "sundry ineffectual attempts, surging round the room in search of his<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "He misses the frightened maid, and seats himself on the lowest step<br>\r\n",

      "like the following: \"Gentlemen! this kind a' thing only happens at<br>\r\n",
      "times, and isn't just the square thing when yer straight; but--seein'<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",

      "stalwart companion, attempting to gain a position by the side of his<br>\r\n",
      "fellow on the steps. He gives a leering wink, contorts his face into<br>\r\n",
      "a dozen grimaces, stares vacantly round the hall (sliding himself<br>\r\n",
      "along on his hands and knees), his glassy eyes inflamed like balls<br>\r\n",
      "of fire. \"It'll be all square soon,\" he growls out.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The poor affrighted servant again attempts-having descended the<br>\r\n",
      "stairs-to relieve her master; but the crawling creature has regained<br>\r\n",
      "his feet. He springs upon her like a fiend, utters a fierce yell,<br>\r\n",
      "and, snatching the lamp from her hand, dashes it upon the tiles,<br>\r\n",
      "spreading the fractured pieces about the hall. Wringing herself from<br>\r\n",
      "his grasp, she leaves a portion of her dress in his bony hand, and<br>\r\n",
      "seeks shelter in a distant part of the hall. Holding up the fragment<br>\r\n",
      "as a trophy, he staggers from place to place, making hieroglyphics<br>\r\n",
      "on the wall with his fingers. His misty mind searches for some point<br>\r\n",
      "of egress. Confronting (rather uncomfortably) hat stands, tables,<br>\r\n",
      "porcelains, and other hall appurtenances, he at length shuffles his<br>\r\n",
      "way back to the stairs, where, as if doubting his bleered optics, he<br>\r\n",
      "stands some moments, swaying to and fro. His hat again falls from<br>\r\n",
      "his head, and his body, following, lays its lumbering length on the<br>\r\n",
      "stairs. Happy fraternity! how useful is that body! His companion,<br>\r\n",
      "laying his muddled head upon it, says it will serve for a pillow.<br>\r\n",

      "their boon companions, who-forming an equanimity of good feeling on<br>\r\n",
      "the floor-join in.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The servant is but a slave, subject to her owner's will; she dare<br>\r\n",
      "not approach him while in such an uncertain condition. Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "cannot intercede, lest his companions, strangers to her, and having<br>\r\n",
      "the appearance of low-bred men, taking advantage of M'Carstrow's<br>\r\n",
      "besotted condition, make rude advances. M'Carstrow, snoring high<br>\r\n",
      "above his cares, will take his comfort upon the tiles.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The servant is supplied with another candle, which, at Franconia's<br>\r\n",
      "bidding, she places in a niche of the hall. It will supply light to<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia has not forgotten that M'Carstrow is her husband; she has<br>\r\n",
      "not forgotten that she owes him a wife's debt of kindness. She<br>\r\n",
      "descends the stairs gently, leans over his besotted body, smooths<br>\r\n",
      "his feverish brow with her hand, and orders the servant to bring a<br>\r\n",
      "soft cushion; which done, she raises his head and places it<br>\r\n",
      "beneath-so gently, so carefully. Her loving heart seems swelling<br>\r\n",
      "with grief, as compassionately she gazes upon him; then, drawing a<br>\r\n",
      "cambric handkerchief from her bosom, spreads it so kindly over his<br>\r\n",
      "face. Woman! there is worth in that last little act. She leaves him<br>\r\n",
      "to enjoy his follies, but regrets their existence. Retiring to the<br>\r\n",
      "drawing-room, agitated and sleepless, she reclines on a lounge to<br>\r\n",
      "await the light of morning. Again the faithful servant, endeavouring<br>\r\n",
      "to appease her mistress's agitation, crouches upon the carpet,<br>\r\n",
      "resting her head on the ottoman at Franconia's feet.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The morning dawns bright and sunny: Franconia has not slept. She has<br>\r\n",
      "passed the hours in watchfulness; has watched the negro sleeping,<br>\r\n",
      "while her thoughts were rivetted to the scene in the hall. She gets<br>\r\n",
      "up, paces the room from the couch to the window, and sits down again<br>\r\n",
      "undecided, unresolved. Taking Diana-such is the servant's name-by<br>\r\n",
      "the hand, she wakes her, and sends her into the hall to ascertain<br>\r\n",
      "the condition of the sleepers. The metamorphosed group, poisoning<br>\r\n",
      "the air with their reeking breath, are still enjoying the morbid<br>\r\n",
      "fruits of their bacchanalianism. Quietly, coolly, and promiscuously,<br>\r\n",
      "they lay as lovingly as fellows of the animal world could desire.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The servant returns, shaking her head. \"Missus, da'h lays yander, so<br>\r\n",
      "in all fixins dat no tellin' which most done gone. Mas'r seems done<br>\r\n",
      "gone, sartin!\" says the servant, her face glowing with apprehension.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The significant phrase alarms Franconia. She repairs to the hall,<br>\r\n",
      "and commences restoring the sleepers to consciousness. The gentlemen<br>\r\n",
      "are doggedly obstinate; they refuse to be disturbed. She recognises<br>\r\n",
      "the face of one whose business it is to reduce men to the last stage<br>\r\n",
      "of poverty. Her sensitive nature shudders at the sight, as she views<br>\r\n",
      "him with a curl of contempt on her lip. \"Oh,<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow,--M'Carstrow!\" she whispers, and taking him by the hand,<br>\r\n",
      "shakes it violently. M'Carstrow, with countenance ghastly and<br>\r\n",
      "inflamed, begins to raise his sluggish head. He sees Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "pensively gazing in his face; and yet he enquires who it is that<br>\r\n",
      "disturbs the progress of his comforts. \"Only me!\" says the good<br>\r\n",
      "woman, soliciting him to leave his companions and accompany her.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Oh, you, is it?\" he replies, grumblingly, rising on his right elbow,<br>\r\n",
      "and rubbing his eyes with his left hand. Wildly and vacantly he<br>\r\n",
      "stares round the hall, as if aroused from a trance, and made<br>\r\n",
      "sensible of his condition.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, me-simply me, who, lost to your affections, is made most<br>\r\n",

      "not of New England in his manners, not of New England in his<br>\r\n",

      "respect or love can she have for the man who degrades her to the<br>\r\n",

      "who lie upon the floor, repulsive, and reeking with the fumes of<br>\r\n",
      "dissipation. \"There are your companions,\" she says.<br>\r\n",

      "It would have been some consolation to know which way he was<br>\r\n",

      "owner. Fate had not ordained this for him; oh no! He must resign<br>\r\n",
      "himself without making any further enquiries; he must be nothing<br>\r\n",
      "more than a nigger--happy nigger happily subdued! Seating himself<br>\r\n",
      "upon the floor, in a recumbent position, he drops his face on his<br>\r\n",
      "knees,--is humbled among the humblest. He is left alone for some<br>\r\n",

      "door opens, and a black boy bearing a dish of homony enters, and,<br>\r\n",

      "new guardian landed him safely at the plantation of Major Wiley, on<br>\r\n",
      "the Tallahatchee River, Mississippi, on the evening of the fourth<br>\r\n",
      "day after their departure, having made a portion of their passage on<br>\r\n",
      "the steamer Ohio. By some process unknown to Harry he finds himself<br>\r\n",
      "duly ingratiated among the major's field hands, as nothing more than<br>\r\n",
      "plain Peter. He is far from the high-road, far from his friends,<br>\r\n",
      "without any prospect of communicating with his old master. The<br>\r\n",
      "major, in his way, seems a well-disposed sort of man, inclined to<br>\r\n",
      "\"do right\" by his negroes, and willing to afford them an opportunity<br>\r\n",
      "of employing their time after task, for their own benefit. And yet<br>\r\n",
      "it is evident that he must in some way be connected with Graspum and<br>\r\n",
      "his party, for there is a continual interchange of negroes to and<br>\r\n",
      "from his plantation. This, however, we must not analyse too closely,<br>\r\n",
      "but leave to the reader's own conjectures, inasmuch as Major Wiley<br>\r\n",
      "is a very distinguished gentleman, and confidently expects a very<br>\r\n",
      "prominent diplomatic appointment under the next administration.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Harry, in a very quiet way, sets himself about gaining a knowledge<br>\r\n",
      "of his master's opinions on religion, as well as obtaining his<br>\r\n",
      "confidence by strict fidelity to his interests. So far does he<br>\r\n",
      "succeed, that in a short time he finds himself holding the<br>\r\n",
      "respectable and confidential office of master of stores. Then he<br>\r\n",
      "succeeds in inducing his master to hear him preach a sermon to his<br>\r\n",
      "negroes. The major is perfectly willing to allow him the full<br>\r\n",
      "exercise of his talents, and is moved to admiration at his fervency,<br>\r\n",
      "his aptitude, his knowledge of the Bible, and the worth there must<br>\r\n",
      "be in such a piece of clergy property. Master Wiley makes his man<br>\r\n",
      "the offer of purchasing his time, which Harry, under the alias of<br>\r\n",
      "Peter, accepts, and commences his mission of preaching on the<br>\r\n",
      "neighbouring plantations.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Ardently and devoutedly does he pursue his mission of Christianity<br>\r\n",
      "among his fellow-bondmen; but he has reaped little of the harvest<br>\r\n",
      "to himself, his master having so increased the demand for his time<br>\r\n",
      "that he can scarcely save money enough to purchase clothes. At first<br>\r\n",
      "he was only required to pay six dollars a week; now, nothing less<br>\r\n",
      "than ten is received. It is a happy premium on profitable human<br>\r\n",
      "nature; and through it swings the strongest hinge of that cursed<br>\r\n",
      "institution which blasts alike master and slave. Major Wiley is very<br>\r\n",
      "chivalrous, very hospitable, and very eminent for his many<br>\r\n",
      "distinguished qualifications; but his very pious piece of property<br>\r\n",
      "must pay forty-seven per cent. annual tribute for the very<br>\r\n",

      "deprived of it seemed more than his spirits could bear. Again and<br>\r\n",
      "again had he appealed to his master for justice; but there was no<br>\r\n",
      "justice for him,--his appeals proved as fruitless as the wind, on his<br>\r\n",
      "master's callous sensibilities. Instead of exciting compassion, he<br>\r\n",
      "only drew upon him his master's prejudices; he was threatened with<br>\r\n",
      "being sold, if he resisted for a day the payment of wages for his<br>\r\n",
      "own body. Hence he saw but one alternative left-one hope, one smile<br>\r\n",
      "from a good woman, who might, and he felt would, deliver him; that<br>\r\n",
      "was in writing to his good friend, Mrs. Rosebrook, whose generous<br>\r\n",
      "heart he might touch through his appeals for mercy. And yet there<br>\r\n",
      "was another obstacle; the post-office might be ten miles off, and<br>\r\n",
      "his master having compelled him to take the name of Peter Wiley, how<br>\r\n",
      "was he to get a letter to her without the knowledge of his master?<br>\r\n",
      "Should his letter be intercepted, his master, a strict<br>\r\n",
      "disciplinarian, would not only sell him farther south, but inflict<br>\r\n",
      "the severest punishment. Nevertheless, there was one consolation<br>\r\n",
      "left; his exertions on behalf of the slaves, and his earnestness in<br>\r\n",
      "promoting the interests of their masters, had not passed unnoticed<br>\r\n",

      "house, sit for hours at his side, and listen with breathless<br>\r\n",
      "attention to his pathos, his display of natural genius. To her he<br>\r\n",
      "unfolded his deep and painful troubles; to her he looked for<br>\r\n",
      "consolation; she was the angel of light guiding him on his weary<br>\r\n",

      "nervousness in his manner, betraying all his efforts at<br>\r\n",
      "dissimulation. He reads the invoice of human property to the<br>\r\n",

      "again at his customers. The culminating point of his profession has<br>\r\n",

      "leading her to the extreme edge of the stand. \"Make us a bid,<br>\r\n",
      "gentlemen, for the pair. I can see in the looks of my customers that<br>\r\n",

      "children. Turning his head aside, as if it may catch the ears of<br>\r\n",

      "after a few minutes' silence, he lights his taper, and sets it upon<br>\r\n",

      "night, and withdraws. \"There, uncle,\" she says, laying her hand<br>\r\n",

      "word with a smile-a smile so sweet, so expressive of her soul's<br>\r\n",
      "goodness. \"You are dear to me, uncle; yes, as dear as a father. How<br>\r\n",

      "round his neck, and impressing a kiss on his care-worn cheek. \"Let<br>\r\n",
      "us forget these things; they are but the fruits of weak nature. It<br>\r\n",

      "table with the refreshing tokens of her friendship. Yielding to<br>\r\n",
      "necessity, the table is spread, and they sit down, with an<br>\r\n",
      "appearance of domestic quietness touchingly humble.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There is some pleasure, after all, in having a quiet spot where we<br>\r\n",
      "can sit down and forget our cares. Perhaps (all said and done) a man<br>\r\n",
      "may call himself prince of his own garret, when he can forget all<br>\r\n",
      "beyond it,\" says Marston affected to tears by Franconia's womanly<br>\r\n",
      "resignation.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" returns Franconia, joyously, \"it's a consolation to know that<br>\r\n",
      "we have people among us much worse off than we are. I confess,<br>\r\n",
      "though, I feel uneasy about our old slaves. Slavery's wrong, uncle;<br>\r\n",
      "and it's when one's reduced to such extremes as are presented in<br>\r\n",
      "this uninviting garret that we realise it the more forcibly. It<br>\r\n",
      "gives the poor wretches no chance of bettering their condition; and<br>\r\n",
      "if one exhibits ever so much talent over the other, there is no<br>\r\n",
      "chance left him to improve it. It is no recompense to the slave that<br>\r\n",
      "his talent only increases the price of the article to be sold. Look<br>\r\n",
      "what Harry would have been had he enjoyed freedom. Uncle, we forget<br>\r\n",
      "our best interests while pondering over the security of a bad<br>\r\n",
      "system. Would it not be better to cultivate the slave's affections,<br>\r\n",
      "rather than oppress his feelings?\" Franconia has their cause at<br>\r\n",
      "heart-forgets her own. She is far removed from the cold speculations<br>\r\n",
      "of the south; she is free from mercenary motives; unstained by that<br>\r\n",
      "principle of logic which recognises only the man merchandise. No<br>\r\n",
      "will hath she to contrive ingenious apologies for the wrongs<br>\r\n",
      "inflicted upon a fallen race. Her words spring from the purest<br>\r\n",
      "sentiment of the soul; they contain a smarting rebuke of Marston's<br>\r\n",
      "former misdoings: but he cannot resent it, nor can he turn the tide<br>\r\n",
      "of his troubles against her noble generosity.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "They had eaten their humble supper of meats and bread, and coffee,<br>\r\n",
      "when Franconia hears a rap at the lower entrance, leading into the<br>\r\n",
      "street. Bearing the taper in her hand, she descends the stairs<br>\r\n",
      "quickly, and, opening the door, recognises the smiling face of Daddy<br>\r\n",
      "Bob. Daddy greets her as if he were surcharged with the very best<br>\r\n",
      "news for old mas'r and missus. He laughs in the exuberance of his<br>\r\n",
      "simplicity, and, with an air of fondness that would better become a<br>\r\n",
      "child, says, \"Lor', young missus, how glad old Bob is to see ye!<br>\r\n",
      "Seems like long time since old man see'd Miss Frankone look so spry.<br>\r\n",
      "Got dat badge.\" The old man shows her his badge, exultingly.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Missus, nobody know whose nigger I'm's, and old Bob arns a right<br>\r\n",
      "smart heap o' money to make mas'r comfortable.\" The old slave never<br>\r\n",
      "for once thinks of his own infirmities; no, his attachment for<br>\r\n",
      "master soars above every thing else; he thinks only in what way he<br>\r\n",
      "can relieve his necessities. Honest, faithful, and affectionate, the<br>\r\n",
      "associations of the past are uppermost in his mind; he forgets his<br>\r\n",
      "slavery in his love for master and the old plantation. Readily would<br>\r\n",
      "he lay down his life, could he, by so doing, lighten the troubles he<br>\r\n",
      "instinctively sees in the changes of master's position. The old<br>\r\n",
      "plantation and its people have been sold; and he, being among the<br>\r\n",
      "separated from earth's chosen, must save his infirm body lest some<br>\r\n",
      "man sell him for the worth thereof. Bob's face is white with beard,<br>\r\n",
      "and his coarse garments are much worn and ragged; but there is<br>\r\n",
      "something pleasing in the familiarity with which Franconia accepts<br>\r\n",
      "his brawny hand. How free from that cold advance, that measured<br>\r\n",
      "welcome, and that religious indifference, with which the would-be<br>\r\n",
      "friend of the slave, at the north, too often accepts the black man's<br>\r\n",
      "hand! There is something in the fervency with which she shakes his<br>\r\n",
      "wrinkled hand that speaks of the goodness of the heart; something<br>\r\n",
      "that touches the old slave's childlike nature. He smiles bashfully,<br>\r\n",
      "and says, \"Glad t' see ye, missus; dat I is: 'spishilly ven ye takes<br>\r\n",
      "care on old mas'r.\" After receiving her salutation he follows her to<br>\r\n",
      "the chamber, across which he hastens to receive a welcome from old<br>\r\n",
      "mas'r. Marston warmly receives his hand, and motions him to be<br>\r\n",
      "seated on the chest near the fire-place. Bob takes his seat, keeping<br>\r\n",
      "his eye on mas'r the while. \"Neber mind, mas'r,\" he says, \"Big Mas'r<br>\r\n",
      "above be better dan Buckra. Da'h is somefin' what Buckra no sell<br>\r\n",
      "from ye, dat's a good heart. If old mas'r on'y keeps up he spirit,<br>\r\n",
      "de Lor' 'll carry un throu' 'e triblation,\" he continues; and, after<br>\r\n",
      "watching his master a few minutes, returns to Franconia, and resumes<br>\r\n",
      "his jargon.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia is the same fair creature Bob watched over when she<br>\r\n",
      "visited the plantation: her countenance wears the same air of<br>\r\n",
      "freshness and frankness; her words are of the same gentleness; she<br>\r\n",
      "seems as solicitous of his comfort as before. And yet a shadow of<br>\r\n",
      "sadness shrouds that vivacity which had made her the welcome guest<br>\r\n",
      "of the old slaves. He cannot resist those expressions which are ever<br>\r\n",
      "ready to lisp forth from the negro when his feelings are excited.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Lor, missus, how old Bob's heart feels! Hah, ah! yah, yah! Looks so<br>\r\n",
      "good, and reminds old Bob how e' look down on dah Astley, yander.<br>\r\n",
      "But, dah somefin in dat ar face what make old nigger like I know<br>\r\n",
      "missus don't feel just right,\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The kind woman reads his thoughts in the glowing simplicity of his<br>\r\n",
      "wrinkled face. \"It has been said that a dog was our last friend,<br>\r\n",
      "Bob: I now think a slave should have been added. Don't you think so,<br>\r\n",
      "uncle?\" she enquires, looking at Marston, and, again taking the old<br>\r\n",
      "slave by the hand, awaits the reply.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We rarely appreciate their friendship until it be too late to<br>\r\n",
      "reward it,\" he replies, with an attempt to smile.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True, true! but the world is full of ingratitude,--very amiable<br>\r\n",
      "ingratitude. Never mind, Daddy; you must now tell me all about your<br>\r\n",
      "affairs, and what has happened since the night you surprised me at<br>\r\n",
      "our house; and you must tell me how you escaped M'Carstrow on the<br>\r\n",
      "morning of the disturbance,\" she enjoins. And while Bob relates his<br>\r\n",
      "story Franconia prepares his supper. Some cold ham, bread, and<br>\r\n",
      "coffee, are soon spread out before him. He will remove them to the<br>\r\n",
      "chest, near the fire-place. \"Why, Missus Frankone,\" he says, \"ye<br>\r\n",
      "sees how I'se so old now dat nobody tink I'se werf ownin; and so<br>\r\n",
      "nobody axes old Bob whose nigger he is. An't prime nigger, now; but<br>\r\n",
      "den a' good fo' work some, and get cash, so t' help old mas'r yander<br>\r\n",
      "(Bob points to old master). Likes t' make old master feel not so<br>\r\n",
      "bad.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" rejoins Marston, \"Bob's good to me. He makes his sleeping<br>\r\n",
      "apartments, when he comes, at the foot of my bed, and shares his<br>\r\n",
      "earnings with me every Saturday night. He's like an old clock that<br>\r\n",
      "can keep time as well as a new one, only wind it up with care.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Dat I is!\" says Daddy, with an exulting nod of the head, as he, to<br>\r\n",
      "his own surprise, lets fall his cup. It was only the negro's<br>\r\n",
      "forgetfulness in the moment of excitement. Giving a wistful look at<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia, he commences picking up the pieces, and drawing his<br>\r\n",
      "week's earnings from a side pocket of his jacket.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Eat your supper, Daddy; never mind your money now\" says Franconia,<br>\r\n",
      "laughing heartily: at which Bob regains confidence and resumes his<br>\r\n",
      "supper, keeping a watchful eye upon his old master the while. Every<br>\r\n",
      "now and then he will pause, cant his ear, and shake his head, as if<br>\r\n",
      "drinking in the tenour of the conversation between Franconia and her<br>\r\n",
      "uncle. Having concluded, he pulls out his money and spreads it upon<br>\r\n",
      "the chest. \"Old Bob work hard fo' dat!\" he says, with emphasis,<br>\r\n",
      "spreading a five-dollar bill and two dollars and fifty cents in<br>\r\n",
      "silver into divisions. \"Dah!\" he ejaculates, \"dat old mas'r share,<br>\r\n",
      "and dis is dis child's.\" The old man looks proudly upon the coin,<br>\r\n",
      "and feels he is not so worthless, after all. \"Now! who say old Bob<br>\r\n",
      "aint werf nofin?\" he concludes, getting up, putting his share into<br>\r\n",
      "his pocket, and then, as if unobserved, slipping the balance into<br>\r\n",
      "Marston's. This done, he goes to the window, affects to be looking<br>\r\n",
      "out, and then resuming his seat upon the chest, commences humming a<br>\r\n",
      "familiar plantation tune, as if his pious feelings had been<br>\r\n",
      "superseded by the recollection of past scenes.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"What, Daddy,--singing songs?\" interrupts Franconia, looking at him<br>\r\n",
      "enquiringly. He stops as suddenly as he commenced, exchanges an<br>\r\n",
      "expressive look, and fain would question her sincerity.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Didn't mean 'um, missus,\" he returns, after a moment's hesitation,<br>\r\n",
      "\"didn't mean 'um. Was thinkin 'bout somefin back'ards; down old<br>\r\n",

      "sadly at variance with our democratic professions. Democracy needs<br>\r\n",
      "to reclaim its all-claiming principles of right and justice for the<br>\r\n",
      "down-trodden. And yet, while the negro generously submits to serve<br>\r\n",

      "sight into the gloomy prospect, and then, as if reluctant to leave<br>\r\n",
      "her uncle, again takes a seat by his side. Gently laying her left<br>\r\n",
      "hand upon his shoulder, she makes an effort at pleasantry, tells him<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The word prison has touched the tender chord upon which all his<br>\r\n",

      "regret, for which there is no recompense in this late hour. \"And<br>\r\n",
      "would you follow me to a prison, Franconia?\" he enquires, throwing<br>\r\n",

      "last,\" rejoins the good woman, the pearly tears brightening in<br>\r\n",
      "mutual sympathy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow, my child, you will find me the unhappy tenant of those<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Nay, uncle, nay! you are only allowing your melancholy forebodings<br>\r\n",
      "to get the better of you. Such men as Graspum-men who have stripped<br>\r\n",
      "families of their all-might take away your property, and leave you<br>\r\n",
      "as they have left my poor parents; but no one would be so heartless<br>\r\n",
      "as to drive you to the extreme of imprisonment. It is a foolish<br>\r\n",
      "result at best.\" Franconia's voice falters; she looks more and more<br>\r\n",
      "intently in her uncle's face, struggles to suppress her rising<br>\r\n",
      "emotions. She knows his frankness, she feels the pain of his<br>\r\n",
      "position; but, though the dreadful extreme seems scarcely possible,<br>\r\n",
      "there is that in his face conveying strong evidence of the truth of<br>\r\n",
      "his remark.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Do not weep, Franconia; spare your tears for a more worthy object:<br>\r\n",
      "such trials have been borne by better men than I. I am but the<br>\r\n",
      "merchandise of my creditors. There is, however, one thing which<br>\r\n",
      "haunts me to grief; could I have saved my children, the pain of my<br>\r\n",
      "position had been slight indeed.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Speak not of them, uncle,\" Franconia interrupts, \"you cannot feel<br>\r\n",
      "the bitterness of their lot more than myself. I have saved a mother,<br>\r\n",
      "but have failed to execute my plan of saving them; and my heart<br>\r\n",
      "throbs with pain when I think that now it is beyond my power. Let me<br>\r\n",
      "not attempt to again excite in your bosom feelings which must ever<br>\r\n",
      "be harassing, for the evil only can work its destruction. To clip<br>\r\n",
      "the poisoning branches and not uproot the succouring trunk, is like<br>\r\n",
      "casting pearls into the waste of time. My heart will ever be with<br>\r\n",
      "the destinies of those children, my feelings bound in unison with<br>\r\n",
      "theirs; our hopes are the same, and if fortune should smile on me in<br>\r\n",
      "times to come I will keep my word-I will snatch them from the<br>\r\n",
      "devouring element of slavery.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Stop, my child!\" speaks Marston, earnestly: \"Remember you can do<br>\r\n",
      "little against the strong arm of the law, and still stronger arm of<br>\r\n",
      "public opinion. Lay aside your hopes of rescuing those children,<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia, and remember that while I am in prison I am the property<br>\r\n",
      "of my creditors, subject to their falsely conceived notions of my<br>\r\n",
      "affairs,\" he continues. \"I cannot now make amends to the law of<br>\r\n",
      "nature,\" he adds, burying his face in his hand, weeping a child's<br>\r\n",
      "tears.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia looks solicitously upon her uncle, as he sorrows. She<br>\r\n",
      "would dry her tears to save his throbbing heart. Her noble<br>\r\n",
      "generosity and disinterestedness have carried her through many<br>\r\n",
      "trials since her marriage, but it fails to nerve her longer. Her's<br>\r\n",
      "is a single-hearted sincerity, dispensing its goodness for the<br>\r\n",
      "benefit of the needy; she suppresses her own troubles that she may<br>\r\n",
      "administer consolation to others. \"The affection that refuses to<br>\r\n",
      "follow misfortune to its lowest step is weak indeed. If you go to<br>\r\n",
      "prison, Franconia will follow you there,\" she says, with touching<br>\r\n",
      "pathos, her musical voice adding strength to the resolution. Blended<br>\r\n",
      "with that soft angelic expression her eyes give forth, her calm<br>\r\n",
      "dignity and inspiring nobleness show how firm is that principle of<br>\r\n",
      "her nature never to abandon her old friend.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The old negro, who had seemed absorbed in his sympathetic<br>\r\n",
      "reflections, gazes steadfastly at his old master, until his emotions<br>\r\n",
      "spring forth in kindest solicitude. Resistance is beyond his power.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Neber mind, old mas'r,\" (he speaks in a devoted tone) \"dar's better<br>\r\n",
      "days comin, bof fo' old Bob and mas'r. Tink 'um sees de day when de<br>\r\n",
      "old plantation jus so 't was wid mas'r and da' old folks.\"<br>\r\n",
      "Concluding in a subdued voice, he approaches Franconia, and seats<br>\r\n",
      "himself, book in hand, on the floor at her feet. Moved by his<br>\r\n",
      "earnestness, she lays her hand playfully upon his head, saying:<br>\r\n",
      "\"Here is our truest friend, uncle!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My own heart lubs Miss Frankone more den eber,\" he whispers in<br>\r\n",
      "return. How pure, how holy, is the simple recompense! It is nature's<br>\r\n",
      "only offering, all the slave can give; and he gives it in the bounty<br>\r\n",
      "of his soul.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Marston's grief having subsided, he attempts to soothe Franconia's<br>\r\n",
      "feelings, by affecting an air of indifference. \"What need I care,<br>\r\n",
      "after all? my resolution should be above it,\" he says, thrusting his<br>\r\n",
      "right hand into his breast pocket, and drawing out a folded paper,<br>\r\n",
      "which he throws upon the little table, and says, \"There, Franconia,<br>\r\n",
      "my child! that contains the climax of my unlamented misfortunes;<br>\r\n",
      "read it: it will show you where my next abode will be-I may be at<br>\r\n",
      "peace there; and there is consolation at being at peace, even in a<br>\r\n",
      "cell.\" He passes the paper into her hand.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "With an expression of surprise she opens it, and glances over its<br>\r\n",
      "contents; then reads it word by word. \"Do they expect to get<br>\r\n",
      "something from nothing?\" she says, sarcastically. \"It is one of<br>\r\n",
      "those soothsayers so valuable to men whose feelings are only with<br>\r\n",
      "money-to men who forget they cannot carry money to the graves; and<br>\r\n",
      "that no tribute is demanded on either road leading to the last abode<br>\r\n",
      "of man.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Stop there, my child! stop!\" interrupts Marston. \"I have given them<br>\r\n",
      "all, 'tis true; but suspicion is my persecutor-suspicion, and trying<br>\r\n",
      "to be a father to my own children!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"It is, indeed, a misfortune to be a father under such<br>\r\n",
      "circumstances, in such an atmosphere!\" the good woman exclaims,<br>\r\n",
      "clasping her hands and looking upward, as if imploring the<br>\r\n",
      "forgiveness of Heaven. Tremblingly she held the paper in her hand,<br>\r\n",
      "until it fell upon the floor, as she, overcome, swooned in her<br>\r\n",
      "uncle's arms.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "She swooned! yes, she swooned. That friend upon whom her affections<br>\r\n",
      "had been concentrated was a prisoner. The paper was a bail writ,<br>\r\n",
      "demanding the body of the accused. The officer serving had been kind<br>\r\n",
      "enough to allow Marston his parole of honour until the next morning.<br>\r\n",
      "He granted this in accordance with Marston's request, that by the<br>\r\n",
      "lenity he might see Daddy Bob and Franconia once more.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Lifting Franconia in his arms, her hair falling loosely down,<br>\r\n",
      "Marston lays her gently on the cot, and commences bathing her<br>\r\n",
      "temples. He has nothing but water to bathe them with,--nothing but<br>\r\n",
      "poverty's liquid. The old negro, frightened at the sudden change<br>\r\n",
      "that has come over his young missus, falls to rubbing and kissing<br>\r\n",
      "her hands,--he has no other aid to lend. Marston has drawn his chair<br>\r\n",
      "beside her, sits down upon it, unbuttons her stomacher, and<br>\r\n",
      "continues bathing and chafing her temples. How gently heaves that<br>\r\n",
      "bosom so full of fondness, how marble-like those features, how<br>\r\n",
      "pallid but touchingly beautiful that face! Love, affection, and<br>\r\n",
      "tenderness, there repose so calmly! All that once gave out so much<br>\r\n",
      "hope, so much joy, now withers before the blighting sting of<br>\r\n",
      "misfortune. \"Poor child, how fondly she loves me!\" says Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "placing his right arm under her head, and raising it gently. The<br>\r\n",
      "motion quickens her senses-she speaks; he kisses her pallid<br>\r\n",
      "cheek-kisses and kisses it. \"Is it you uncle?\" she whispers. She has<br>\r\n",
      "opened her eyes, stares at Marston, then wildly along the ceiling.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm in uncle's arms; how good!\" she continues, as if fatigued.<br>\r\n",
      "Reclining back on the pillow, she again rests her head upon his arm.<br>\r\n",
      "\"I am at the mansion-how pleasant; let me rest, uncle; let me rest.<br>\r\n",
      "Send aunt Rachel to me.\" She raises her right hand and lays her arms<br>\r\n",

      "he sets about clearing away the little things, and, when done, draws<br>\r\n",
      "his seat close to Marston, at the fire-place. As if quite at home<br>\r\n",
      "beside his old master, he eyes Marston intently for some time,--seems<br>\r\n",
      "studying his thoughts and fears. At length the old slave commences<br>\r\n",
      "disclosing his feelings. His well-worn bones are not worth a large<br>\r\n",
      "sum; nor are the merits of his worthy age saleable;--no! there is<br>\r\n",
      "nothing left but his feelings, those genuine virtues so happily<br>\r\n",
      "illustrated. Daddy Bob will stand by mas'r, as he expresses it, in<br>\r\n",
      "power or in prison. Kindness has excited all that vanity in Bob so<br>\r\n",
      "peculiar to the negro, and by which he prides himself in the prime<br>\r\n",
      "value of his person. There he sits-Marston's faithful friend,<br>\r\n",
      "contemplating his silence with a steady gaze, and then, giving his<br>\r\n",
      "jet-black face a double degree of seriousness, shrugs his shoulders,<br>\r\n",
      "significantly nods his head, and intimates that it will soon be time<br>\r\n",
      "to retire, by commencing to unboot master.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You seem in a hurry to get rid of me, Daddy! Want to get your own<br>\r\n",
      "cranium into a pine-knot sleep, eh?\" says Marston, with an<br>\r\n",
      "encouraging smile, pulling the old slave's whiskers in a playful<br>\r\n",
      "manner.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No, Boss; 'tant dat,\" returns Bob, keeping on tugging at Marston's<br>\r\n",
      "boots until he has got them from his feet, and safely stowed away in<br>\r\n",
      "a corner. A gentle hint that he is all ready to relieve Marston of<br>\r\n",
      "his upper garments brings him to his feet, when Bob commences upon<br>\r\n",
      "him in right good earnest, and soon has him stowed away between the<br>\r\n",
      "sheets. \"Bob neber likes to hurry old Boss, but den 'e kno' what's<br>\r\n",
      "on old Mas'r's feelins, an 'e kno' dat sleep make 'um forget 'um!\"<br>\r\n",
      "rejoins Bob, in a half whisper that caught Marston's ear, as he<br>\r\n",
      "patted and fussed about his pillow, in order to make him as<br>\r\n",
      "comfortable as circumstances would admit. After this he extinguishes<br>\r\n",
      "the light, and, accustomed to a slave's bed, lumbers himself down on<br>\r\n",
      "the floor beside his master's cot. Thus, watchfully, he spends the<br>\r\n",
      "night.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "When morning dawned, Bob was in the full enjoyment of what the negro<br>\r\n",
      "so pertinently calls a long and strong sleep. He cannot resist its<br>\r\n",
      "soothing powers, nor will master disturb him in its enjoyment.<br>\r\n",
      "Before breakfast-time arrives, however, he arouses with a loud<br>\r\n",
      "guffaw, looks round the room vacantly, as if he were doubting the<br>\r\n",
      "presence of things about him. Rising to his knees, he rubs his eyes<br>\r\n",
      "languidly, yawns, and stretches his arms, scratches his head, and<br>\r\n",
      "suddenly gets a glimpse of old master, who is already dressed, and<br>\r\n",
      "sits by the window, his attention intently set upon some object<br>\r\n",
      "without. The old slave recognises the same chamber from which he<br>\r\n",
      "guided Franconia on the night before, and, after saluting mas'r,<br>\r\n",
      "sets about arranging the domestic affairs of the apartment, and<br>\r\n",
      "preparing the breakfast table, the breakfast being cooked at Aunt<br>\r\n",
      "Beckie's cabin, in the yard. Aunt Beckie had the distinguished<br>\r\n",
      "satisfaction of knowing Marston in his better days, and now esteems<br>\r\n",
      "it an honour to serve him, even in his poverty. Always happy to<br>\r\n",
      "inform her friends that she was brought up a first-rate pastry-cook,<br>\r\n",
      "she now adds, with great satisfaction, that she pays her owner, the<br>\r\n",
      "very Reverend Mr. Thomas Tippletony, the ever-pious rector of St.<br>\r\n",
      "Michael's, no end of money for her time, and makes a good profit at<br>\r\n",
      "her business beside. Notwithstanding she has a large family of<br>\r\n",
      "bright children to maintain in a respectable way, she hopes for a<br>\r\n",
      "continuance of their patronage, and will give the best terms her<br>\r\n",
      "limited means admit. She knows how very necessary it is for a<br>\r\n",
      "southern gentleman who would be anybody to keep up appearances, and,<br>\r\n",
      "with little means, to make a great display: hence she is very easy<br>\r\n",
      "in matters of payment. In Marston's case, she is extremely proud to<br>\r\n",
      "render him service,--to \"do for him\" as far as she can, and wait a<br>\r\n",
      "change for the better concerning any balance outstanding.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Bob fetches the breakfast of coffee, fritters, homony, and bacon,--a<br>\r\n",
      "very good breakfast it is, considering the circumstances,--and<br>\r\n",
      "spreads the little rustic board with an air of comfort and neatness<br>\r\n",
      "complimentary to the old slave's taste. And, withal, the old man<br>\r\n",
      "cannot forego the inherent vanity of his nature, for he is,<br>\r\n",
      "unconsciously, performing all the ceremonies of attendance he has<br>\r\n",
      "seen Dandy and his satellites go through at the plantation mansion.<br>\r\n",
      "He fusses and grins, and praises and laughs, as he sets the dishes<br>\r\n",
      "down one by one, keeping a watchful eye on mas'r, as if to detect an<br>\r\n",
      "approval in his countenance. \"Reckon 'ow dis old nigger can fix old<br>\r\n",
      "Boss up aristocratic breakfast like Dandy. Now, Boss-da'h he is!\" he<br>\r\n",
      "says, whisking round the table, setting the cups just so, and<br>\r\n",
      "spreading himself with exultation. \"Want to see master smile-laugh<br>\r\n",
      "some-like 'e used down on da'h old plantation!\" he ejaculates,<br>\r\n",
      "emphatically, placing a chair at Marston's plate. This done, he<br>\r\n",
      "accompanies his best bow with a scrape of his right foot, spreads<br>\r\n",
      "his hands,--the gesture being the signal of readiness. Marston takes<br>\r\n",
      "his chair, as Bob affects the compound dignity of the very best<br>\r\n",
      "trained nigger, doing the distinguished in waiting.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"A little less ceremony, my old faithful! the small follies of<br>\r\n",
      "etiquette ill become such a place as this. We must succumb to<br>\r\n",
      "circumstances: come, sit down, Bob; draw your bench to the chest,<br>\r\n",
      "and there eat your share, while I wait on myself,\" says Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "touching Bob on the arm. The words were no sooner uttered, than<br>\r\n",
      "Bob's countenance changed from the playful to the serious; he could<br>\r\n",
      "see nothing but dignity in master, no matter in what sphere he might<br>\r\n",
      "be placed. His simple nature recoils at the idea of dispensing with<br>\r\n",
      "the attention due from slave to master. Master's fallen fortunes,<br>\r\n",
      "and the cheerless character of the chamber, are nothing to Daddy-<br>\r\n",
      "master must keep up his dignity.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You need'nt look so serious, Daddy; it only gives an extra shade to<br>\r\n",
      "your face, already black enough for any immediate purpose!\" says<br>\r\n",
      "Marston, turning round and smiling at the old slave's discomfiture.<br>\r\n",
      "To make amends, master takes a plate from the table, and gives Bob a<br>\r\n",
      "share of his homony and bacon. This is very pleasing to the old<br>\r\n",
      "slave, who regains his wonted earnestness, takes the plate politely<br>\r\n",
      "from his master's hand, retires with it to the chest, and keeps up a<br>\r\n",
      "regular fire of chit-chat while dispensing its contents. In this<br>\r\n",
      "humble apartment, master and slave-the former once opulent, and the<br>\r\n",
      "latter still warm with attachment for his friend-are happily<br>\r\n",
      "companioned. They finish their breakfast,--a long pause intervenes.<br>\r\n",
      "\"I would I were beyond the bounds of this our south,\" says Marston,<br>\r\n",
      "breaking the silence, as he draws his chair and seats himself by the<br>\r\n",
      "window, where he can look out upon the dingy little houses in the<br>\r\n",
      "lane.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The unhappy man feels the burden of a misspent life; he cannot<br>\r\n",
      "recall the past, nor make amends for its errors. But, withal, it is<br>\r\n",
      "some relief that he can disclose his feelings to the old man, his<br>\r\n",
      "slave.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Mas'r,\" interrupts the old slave, looking complacently in his face,<br>\r\n",
      "\"Bob 'll fowler ye, and be de same old friend. I will walk behind<br>\r\n",
      "Miss Frankone.\" His simple nature seems warming into fervency.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ah! old man,\" returns Marston, \"if there be a wish (you may go<br>\r\n",
      "before me, though) I have on earth, it is that when I die our graves<br>\r\n",
      "may be side by side, with an epitaph to denote master, friend, and<br>\r\n",
      "faithful servant lie here.\" He takes the old man by the hand again,<br>\r\n",
      "as the tears drop from his cheeks. \"A prison is but a grave to the<br>\r\n",
      "man of honourable feelings,\" he concludes. Thus disclosing his<br>\r\n",
      "feelings, a rap at the door announces a messenger. It is nine<br>\r\n",
      "o'clock, and immediately the sheriff, a gentlemanly-looking man,<br>\r\n",
      "wearing the insignia of office on his hat, walks in, and politely<br>\r\n",
      "intimates that, painful as may be the duty, he must request his<br>\r\n",
      "company to the county gaol, that place so accommodatingly prepared<br>\r\n",
      "for the reception of unfortunates.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Sorry for your misfortunes, sir! but we'll try to make you as<br>\r\n",
      "comfortable as we can in our place.\" The servitor of the law seems<br>\r\n",
      "to have some sympathy in him. \"I have my duty to perform, you know,<br>\r\n",
      "sir; nevertheless, I have my opinion about imprisoning honest men<br>\r\n",
      "for debt: it's a poor satisfaction, sir. I'm only an officer, you<br>\r\n",
      "see, sir, not a law-maker-never want to be, sir. I very much dislike<br>\r\n",
      "to execute these kind of writs,\" says the man of the law, as, with<br>\r\n",
      "an expression of commiseration, he glances round the room, and then<br>\r\n",
      "at Daddy, who has made preparations for a sudden dodge, should such<br>\r\n",
      "an expedient be found necessary.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Nay, sheriff, think nothing of it; it's but a thing of common<br>\r\n",
      "life,--it may befall us all. I can be no exception to the rule, and<br>\r\n",
      "may console myself with the knowledge of companionship,\" replies<br>\r\n",
      "Marston, as coolly as if he were preparing for a journey of<br>\r\n",
      "pleasure.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "How true it is, that, concealed beneath the smallest things, there<br>\r\n",
      "is a consolation which necessity may bring out: how Providence has<br>\r\n",
      "suited it to our misfortunes!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There are a few things here-a very few-I should like to take to my<br>\r\n",
      "cell; perhaps I can send for them,\" he remarks, looking at the<br>\r\n",
      "officer, enquiringly.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My name is Martin-Captain Martin, they call me,\"-returns that<br>\r\n",
      "functionary, politely. \"If you accept my word of honour, I pledge it<br>\r\n",
      "they are taken care of, and sent to your apartments.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You mean my new lodging-house, or my new grave, I suppose,\"<br>\r\n",
      "interrupted Marston, jocosely, pointing out to Daddy the few<br>\r\n",
      "articles of bedding, chairs, and a window-curtain he desired<br>\r\n",
      "removed. Daddy has been pensively standing by the fire-place the<br>\r\n",
      "while, contemplating the scene.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Marston soon announces his readiness to proceed; and, followed by<br>\r\n",
      "the old slave, the officer leads the way down the ricketty old<br>\r\n",
      "stairs to the street. \"I's gwine t'see whar dey takes old mas'r, any<br>\r\n",
      "how, reckon I is,\" says the old slave, giving his head a significant<br>\r\n",
      "turn.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, sir,\" interrupts the officer, as they arrive at the bottom of<br>\r\n",
      "the stairs, \"perhaps you have a delicacy about going through the<br>\r\n",
      "street with a sheriff; many men have: therefore I shall confide in<br>\r\n",
      "your honour, sir, and shall give you the privilege of proceeding to<br>\r\n",
      "the gaol as best suits your feelings. I never allow myself to follow<br>\r\n",
      "the will of creditors; if I did, my duties would be turned into a<br>\r\n",
      "system of tyranny, to gratify their feelings only. Now, you may take<br>\r\n",
      "a carriage, or walk; only meet me at the prison gate.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Thanks, thanks!\" returns Marston, grateful for the officer's<br>\r\n",
      "kindness, \"my crime is generosity; you need not fear me. My old<br>\r\n",
      "faithful here will guide me along.\" The officer bows assent, and<br>\r\n",
      "with a respectful wave of the hand they separate to pursue different<br>\r\n",
      "routes.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Marston walks slowly along, Bob keeping pace close behind. He passes<br>\r\n",
      "many of his old acquaintances, who, in better times, would have<br>\r\n",
      "recognised him with a cordial embrace; at present they have scarcely<br>\r\n",
      "a nod to spare. Marston, however, is firm in his resolution, looks<br>\r\n",
      "not on one side nor the other, and reaches the prison-gate in good<br>\r\n",
      "time. The officer has reached it in advance, and waits him there.<br>\r\n",
      "They pause a few moments as Marston scans the frowning wall that<br>\r\n",
      "encloses the gloomy-looking old prison. \"I am ready to go in,\" says<br>\r\n",
      "Marston; and just as they are about to enter the arched gate, the<br>\r\n",
      "old slave touches him on the arm, and says, \"Mas'r, dat's no place<br>\r\n",
      "fo'h Bob. Can't stand seein' on ye locked up wid sich folks as in<br>\r\n",
      "dah!\" Solicitously he looks in his master's face. The man of trouble<br>\r\n",
      "grasps firmly the old slave's hand, holds it in silence for some<br>\r\n",
      "minutes-the officer, moved by the touching scene, turns his head<br>\r\n",
      "away-as tears course down his cheeks. He has no words to speak the<br>\r\n",
      "emotions of his heart; he shakes the old man's hand affectionately,<br>\r\n",
      "attempts to whisper a word in his ear, but is too deeply affected.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Good by, mas'r: may God bless 'um! Ther's a place fo'h old mas'r<br>\r\n",
      "yet. I'll com t' see mas'r every night,\" says the old man, his words<br>\r\n",
      "flowing from the bounty of his heart. He turns away reluctantly,<br>\r\n",
      "draws his hand from Marston's, heaves a sigh, and repairs to his<br>\r\n",
      "labour. How precious was that labour of love, wherein the old slave<br>\r\n",
      "toils that he may share the proceeds with his master!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "As Marston and the sheriff disappear through the gate, and are about<br>\r\n",
      "to ascend the large stone steps leading to the portal in which is<br>\r\n",
      "situated the inner iron gate opening into the debtors' ward, the<br>\r\n",
      "sheriff made a halt, and, placing his arm in a friendly manner<br>\r\n",
      "through Marston's, enquires, \"Anything I can do for you? If there<br>\r\n",
      "is, just name it. Pardon my remark, sir, but you will, in all<br>\r\n",
      "probability, take the benefit of the act; and, as no person seems<br>\r\n",
      "willing to sign your bail, I may do something to relieve your wants,<br>\r\n",
      "in my humble way.\" Marston shakes his head; the kindness impedes an<br>\r\n",
      "expression of his feelings. \"A word of advice from me, however, may<br>\r\n",
      "not be without its effect, and I will give it you; it is this:--Your<br>\r\n",
      "earnestness to save those two children, and the singular manner in<br>\r\n",
      "which those slave drudges of Graspum produced the documentary<br>\r\n",
      "testimony showing them property, has created wondrous suspicion<br>\r\n",
      "about your affairs. I will here say, Graspum's no friend of yours;<br>\r\n",
      "in fact, he's a friend to nobody but himself; and even now, when<br>\r\n",
      "questioned on the manner of possessing all your real estate, he<br>\r\n",
      "gives out insinuations, which, instead of exonerating you, create a<br>\r\n",
      "still worse impression against you. His conversation on the matter<br>\r\n",
      "leaves the inference with your creditors that you have still more<br>\r\n",
      "property secreted. Hence, mark me! it behoves you to keep close<br>\r\n",
      "lips. Don't let your right hand know what your left does,\" continues<br>\r\n",
      "the officer, in a tone of friendliness. They ascend to the iron<br>\r\n",
      "gate, look through the grating. The officer, giving a whistle, rings<br>\r\n",
      "the bell by touching a spring in the right-hand wall. \"My lot at<br>\r\n",
      "last!\" exclaims Marston. \"How many poor unfortunates have passed<br>\r\n",
      "this threshold-how many times the emotions of the heart have burst<br>\r\n",
      "forth on this spot-how many have here found a gloomy rest from their<br>\r\n",
      "importuners-how many have here whiled away precious time in a gloomy<br>\r\n",
      "cell, provided for the punishment of poverty!\" The disowned man, for<br>\r\n",
      "such he is, struggles to retain his resolution; fain would he,<br>\r\n",
      "knowing the price of that resolution, repress those sensations<br>\r\n",
      "threatening to overwhelm him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The brusque gaoler appears at the iron gate; stands his burly figure<br>\r\n",
      "in the portal; nods recognition to the officer; swings back the iron<br>\r\n",
      "frame, as a number of motley prisoners gather into a semicircle in<br>\r\n",
      "the passage. \"Go back, prisoners; don't stare so at every new<br>\r\n",
      "comer,\" says the gaoler, clearing the way with his hands extended.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "One or two of the locked-up recognise Marston. They lisp strange<br>\r\n",
      "remarks, drawn forth by his appearance in charge of an officer. \"Big<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There's not much hospitality for poverty,\" rejoins a third,<br>\r\n",
      "mutteringly. \"Southern hospitality is unsound, shallow, and flimsy;<br>\r\n",

      "sure to find a people who maintain the grossest errors in their<br>\r\n",
      "political system laying the greatest claims to benevolence and<br>\r\n",
      "principle-things to which they never had a right. The phantom of<br>\r\n",
      "hospitality draws the curtain over many a vice-it is a well-told<br>\r\n",
      "nothingness ornamenting the beggared system of your slavery; that's<br>\r\n",
      "my honest opinion,\" says a third, in a gruff voice, which indicates<br>\r\n",
      "that he has no very choice opinion of such generosity. \"If they want<br>\r\n",
      "a specimen of true hospitality, they must go to New England; there<br>\r\n",

      "justice; and from them spring the living good of all,\" he concludes;<br>\r\n",
      "and folding his arms with an air of independence, walks up the long<br>\r\n",
      "passage running at right angles with the entrance portal, and<br>\r\n",

      "them with a weapon of raw hide, to which he gave the singular<br>\r\n",
      "cognomen of \"hell-fire.\" When extra punishment was-according to his<br>\r\n",
      "policy-necessary to bring out the \"digs,\" he would lock them up in<br>\r\n",
      "his cage (a sort of grated sentry-box, large enough to retain the<br>\r\n",

      "that our society don't respect 'um because they must mix with the<br>\r\n",
      "black rascals in following their trades; and this works its way into<br>\r\n",
      "their feelings so, that the best on 'um from the north soon give<br>\r\n",

      "watch-makers, clergymen!\" He always keeps a good supply on hand, and<br>\r\n",
      "has the very best means of supply. So Mr. Grabguy makes a purchase<br>\r\n",
      "of three prime men, whom he intends to transform into first-rate<br>\r\n",
      "mechanics. He declares he will not be troubled hereafter with those<br>\r\n",
      "very miserable white workmen he is constrained to import from the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ought to,\" rejoins Graspum, stoically; \"he's got right good stock<br>\r\n",

      "valuable. He will return to the table. Taking his seat again, he<br>\r\n",
      "draws forth a piece of paper, and with his pencil commences figuring<br>\r\n",
      "upon it. He wants to get at the cost of free and slave labour, and<br>\r\n",
      "the relative advantages of the one over the other. After a deal of<br>\r\n",
      "multiplying and subtracting, he gives it up in despair. The fine<br>\r\n",

      "contemplation. He won't bother another minute; figures are only<br>\r\n",
      "confusions: so far as using them to compute the relative value of<br>\r\n",

      "with interest. Mr. Grabguy's paper is good, and Graspum considers it<br>\r\n",

      "\"Better drop the Marston, as things are. A good many high feeling<br>\r\n",

      "his files. In a few minutes more-Graspum, in his chair of state, is<br>\r\n",
      "regretting having sold so quick,--Mr. Grabguy is handed his bill of<br>\r\n",
      "sale, duly made out. At the same time, that sedate official places<br>\r\n",
      "the note for the amount into Graspum's hands. Graspum examines it<br>\r\n",
      "minutely, while Mr. Grabguy surveys the bill of sale. \"Mr. Benson,<br>\r\n",
      "my clerk here, does these things up according to legal tenour; he,<br>\r\n",

      "rather celebrated once; but the profession won't pay a man of his<br>\r\n",

      "of the piece of paper taken in exchange for the human 'imp.'<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Clap your name across the face!\" demands Graspum; and Grabguy<br>\r\n",
      "seizes a pen, and quickly consummates the bargain by inscribing his<br>\r\n",
      "name, passing it to Mr. Benson, and, in return, receiving the bill<br>\r\n",
      "of sale, which he places in his breast pocket. He will not trouble<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Benson any further; but, if he will supply a small piece of<br>\r\n",

      "estimation of the Rosebrook negroes-who are notoriously aristocratic<br>\r\n",

      "the support of a minister of the Gospel, his respectability is a<br>\r\n",
      "particular object of their watchfulness. Thus, Harry's first<br>\r\n",
      "appearance on the plantation, shabbily dressed, is viewed with<br>\r\n",

      "presence, and with the affection of a child shook, and shook, and<br>\r\n",
      "shook his hand, as he fell on his knees and kissed hers. \"Poor<br>\r\n",

      "which his name was changed,--the sum he was compelled to pay for his<br>\r\n",
      "time, and the good he effected while pursuing the object of his<br>\r\n",
      "mission on the neighbouring plantations. Hope carried him through<br>\r\n",
      "every trial,--hope prepared his heart for the time of his<br>\r\n",
      "delivery,--hope filled his soul with gratitude to his Maker, and<br>\r\n",
      "hope, which ever held its light of freedom before him, inspired him<br>\r\n",
      "with that prayer he so thankfully bestowed on the head of his<br>\r\n",

      "angels' wings.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Moved to tears by his recital of past struggles, and the expression<br>\r\n",

      "them, ever praying and trusting to Him who guides our course in<br>\r\n",
      "life, Franconia in turn commenced relating the misfortunes that had<br>\r\n",
      "befallen her uncle. She tells him how her uncle has been reduced to<br>\r\n",
      "poverty through Lorenzo's folly, and Graspum, the negro dealer's<br>\r\n",
      "undiscoverable mode of ensnaring the unwary. He has been importuned,<br>\r\n",

      "venerable prime minister, Daddy Daniel, a purse containing twelve<br>\r\n",
      "dollars and fifty cents. It is the amount of a voluntary<br>\r\n",
      "contribution-a gift for the new preacher. \"Missus\" is requested,<br>\r\n",
      "after adding her portion, to expend it in a suit of best black for<br>\r\n",

      "once joyous master now in prison; but, misgivings being useless,<br>\r\n",
      "onward he goes. And he will see old Bob, recall the happy incidents<br>\r\n",
      "of the past, when time went smoothly on.<br>\r\n",

      "in a fashionable house, to the inmates of which he is familiarly<br>\r\n",
      "known. He certainly leads his beautiful wife anything but a pleasant<br>\r\n",
      "or happy life. Soon Franconia is ready, and onward wending her way<br>\r\n",
      "for the gaol, closely followed by Harry. She would have no objection<br>\r\n",
      "to his walking by her side, but custom (intolerant interposer) will<br>\r\n",
      "not permit it. They pass through busy thoroughfares and narrow<br>\r\n",
      "streets into the suburbs, and have reached the prison outer gate, on<br>\r\n",
      "the right hand of which, and just above a brass knob, are the<br>\r\n",

      "advancing through the corridor to challenge his presence. The man<br>\r\n",
      "advances, and has reached the inner iron gate, situated in a narrow,<br>\r\n",
      "vaulted arch in the main building. A clanking and clicking sound is<br>\r\n",
      "heard, and the iron door swings back: a thick-set man, with features<br>\r\n",
      "of iron, advances to the stoop, down the steps, and to the gate.<br>\r\n",
      "\"What's here now?\" he growls, rather than speaks, looking sternly at<br>\r\n",

      "dozen times! but I didn't recognise ye on the outer side,\" continues<br>\r\n",
      "the official, becoming suddenly servile. He makes a low bow as he<br>\r\n",
      "recognises Franconia-motions his hand for them to walk ahead. They<br>\r\n",
      "reach the steps leading to the inner gate, and ascending, soon are<br>\r\n",
      "in the vaulted passage.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "If they will allow him, the polite official will unlock the grated<br>\r\n",
      "door. Stepping before Franconia, who, as the clanking of the locks<br>\r\n",
      "grate on her ear, is seized with sensations she cannot describe, he<br>\r\n",
      "inserts the heavy key. She turns to Harry, her face pallid as<br>\r\n",
      "marble, and lays her tremulous hand on his arm, as if to relieve the<br>\r\n",
      "nervousness with which she is seized. Click! click! sounds forth:<br>\r\n",
      "again the door creaks on its hinges, and they are in the confines of<br>\r\n",
      "the prison. A narrow vaulted arch, its stone walls moistened with<br>\r\n",
      "pestilential malaria, leads into a small vestibule, on the right<br>\r\n",
      "hand of which stretched a narrow aisle lined on both sides with<br>\r\n",
      "cells. Damp and pestiferous, a hollow gloominess seems to pervade<br>\r\n",
      "the place, as if it were a pest-house for torturing the living.<br>\r\n",
      "Even the air breathes of disease,--a stench, as of dead men buried in<br>\r\n",
      "its vaults, darts its poison deep into the system. It is this,<br>\r\n",
      "coupled with the mind's discontent, that commits its ravages upon<br>\r\n",
      "the poor prisoner,--that sends him pale and haggard to a soon-<br>\r\n",
      "forgotten grave.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Last door on the right,--you know, mum,\" says the official: \"boy<br>\r\n",

      "\"I know, to my sorrow,\" is her reply, delivered in a whisper. Ah!<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"He's sick: walk softly, and don't think of the prisoners. Knock at<br>\r\n",

      "from a small door on the left hand of the vestibule.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Zist! zist!\" returns the other, pointing with the forefinger of his<br>\r\n",
      "right hand down the aisle, and, placing his left, gently, on<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia's shoulder, motioning her to move on.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Slowly, her handkerchief to her face, she obeys the sign, and is<br>\r\n",
      "moving down the corridor, now encountering anxious eyes peering<br>\r\n",
      "through the narrow grating of huge black doors. And then a faint,<br>\r\n",
      "dolorous sound strikes on their listening ears. They pause for a<br>\r\n",
      "moment,--listen again! It becomes clearer and clearer; and they<br>\r\n",
      "advance with anxious curiosity. \"It's Daddy Bob's voice,\" whispers<br>\r\n",
      "Harry; \"but how distant it sounds!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Even that murmurs in his confinement,\" returns Franconia.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"How, like a thing of life, it recalls the past-the past of<br>\r\n",
      "happiness!\" says Harry, as they reach the cell door, and,<br>\r\n",
      "tremulously, hesitate for a few moments.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Listen again!\" continues Harry. The sound having ceased a moment or<br>\r\n",
      "two, again commences, and the word \"There's a place for old mas'r<br>\r\n",
      "yet, And de Lord will see him dar,\" are distinctly audible. \"How the<br>\r\n",
      "old man battles for his good master!\" returns Harry, as Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "taps gently on the door. The wooden trap over the grating is closed;<br>\r\n",
      "bolts hang carelessly from their staples; and yet, though the door<br>\r\n",
      "is secured with a hook on the inside, disease and death breathe<br>\r\n",
      "their morbid fumes through the scarce perceptible crevices. A<br>\r\n",
      "whispering-\"Come in!\" is heard in reply to the tap upon the door,<br>\r\n",
      "which slowly opens, and the face of old Bob, bathed in grief,<br>\r\n",
      "protrudes round the frame. \"Oh, missus-missus-missus-God give good<br>\r\n",
      "missus spirit!\" he exclaims, seizing Franconia fervently by the<br>\r\n",
      "hand, and looking in her face imploringly. A fotid stench pervaded<br>\r\n",
      "the atmosphere of the gloomy cell; it is death spreading its humid<br>\r\n",
      "malaria. \"Good old master is g-g-g-gone!\" mutters the negro, in<br>\r\n",
      "half-choked accents.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "With a wild shriek, the noble woman rushes to the side of his prison<br>\r\n",
      "cot, seizes his blanched hand that hangs carelessly over the iron<br>\r\n",
      "frame, grasps his head frantically, and draws it to her bosom, as<br>\r\n",
      "the last gurgle of life bids adieu to the prostrate body. He is<br>\r\n",
      "dead!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The old slave has watched over him, shared his sorrows and his<br>\r\n",
      "crust, has sung a last song to his departing spirit. How truthful<br>\r\n",
      "was that picture of the dying master and his slave! The old man,<br>\r\n",
      "struggling against the infirmities of age, had escaped the hands of<br>\r\n",
      "the man-seller, served his master with but one object-his soul's<br>\r\n",
      "love-and relieved his necessities, until death, ending his troubles,<br>\r\n",
      "left no more to relieve. Now, distracted between joy at meeting<br>\r\n",
      "Harry, and sorrow for the death of master, the poor old man is lost<br>\r\n",
      "in the confusion of his feelings. After saluting Franconia, he<br>\r\n",
      "turned to Harry, threw his arms around his neck, buried his head in<br>\r\n",
      "his bosom, and wept like a child. \"Home-home again,--my Harry! but<br>\r\n",
      "too late to see mas'r,\" he says, as the fountains of his soul give<br>\r\n",
      "out their streams.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We must all go where master has gone,\" returns Harry, as he, more<br>\r\n",
      "calm, fondles the old man, and endeavours to reconcile his feelings.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Sit there, my old friend-sit there; and remember that God called<br>\r\n",
      "master away. I must go to his bed-side,\" whispers Harry, seating the<br>\r\n",

      "is, that while sympathy for the living may cost something, sympathy<br>\r\n",
      "for the dead is cheap indeed, and always to be had. How simply plain<br>\r\n",

      "is the soft tone in which they are uttered,--it gives new life to old<br>\r\n",
      "images. So forcibly are they called up, that the good woman has no<br>\r\n",
      "power to resist her violent emotions: gently she guides Franconia to<br>\r\n",

      "returns. The gates are shut: Harry must wile away the night, in this<br>\r\n",
      "tomb-like abode, with the dead. What stillness pervades the cell;<br>\r\n",

      "through the lattice bars; mosquitoes sing their torturous tunes<br>\r\n",

      "debtor; but the laws are so curious, creditors are so obdurate, and<br>\r\n",
      "sheriffs have such a crooked way of doing straight things, that he<br>\r\n",
      "is in the very bad position of not knowing what to do. Some document<br>\r\n",
      "from the sheriff may be necessary; perhaps the creditors must agree<br>\r\n",
      "to the compromise. He forgets that inexorable Death, as he is<br>\r\n",
      "vulgarly styled, has forced a compromise: creditors must now credit<br>\r\n",
      "\"by decease.\" Upon this point, however, he must be satisfied by his<br>\r\n",
      "superior. He now wishes Mr. Brien Moon would evince more exactness<br>\r\n",
      "in holding inquests, and less anxiety for the fees. Mr. Winterflint<br>\r\n",
      "depends not on his own decisions, where the laws relating to debtors<br>\r\n",
      "are so absurdly mystical. \"Rest here, boy,\" he says; \"I won't be a<br>\r\n",
      "minute or two,--must do the thing straight.\" He seeks the presence of<br>\r\n",
      "that extremely high functionary, the gaoler (high indeed wherever<br>\r\n",

      "\"Mas'r's death-bed wasn't much at last,\" says Duncan, as they gather<br>\r\n",
      "round the cot, and, with curious faces, mingle their more curious<br>\r\n",
      "remarks. Harry draws back the white handkerchief which Franconia had<br>\r\n",
      "spread over the face of the corpse, as the negroes start back<br>\r\n",
      "affrighted. As of nervous contortion, the ghastly face presents an<br>\r\n",
      "awful picture. Swollen, discoloured, and contracted, no one outline<br>\r\n",
      "of that once cheerful countenance can be traced. \"Don't look much<br>\r\n",

      "debtor's exit. Harry again covers the face, and prepares to roll the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "With Harry as the only follower, they proceed along, through<br>\r\n",

      "consoling, but he cannot remodel the past for the advantage of the<br>\r\n",
      "dead. Soon the body is placed in a \"ready-made coffin,\" and the good<br>\r\n",

      "the body away to its last resting-place; and, in a paroxysm of<br>\r\n",
      "grief, she shrieks and falls swooning to the floor.<br>\r\n",

      "world gave the fallen man nothing but a prison-cell wherein to<br>\r\n",
      "stretch his dying body; a woman gives him a sequestered grave, and<br>\r\n",
      "nature spreads it with her loveliest offering. It is the last<br>\r\n",

      "partaking of that contentment so characteristic of the family, have<br>\r\n",

      "strange regrets. Sympathy is let loose, and is expanding itself to<br>\r\n",
      "an unusual degree. Who was there that did not know Marston's<br>\r\n",
      "generous, gushing soul! Who was there that would not have stretched<br>\r\n",

      "ready to pour forth the unmistakeable tokens of friendship! How many<br>\r\n",
      "were only restrained from doing good-from giving vent to the<br>\r\n",
      "fountains of their hospitality-through fear of being contaminated<br>\r\n",
      "with that scandal rumour had thrown around his decline! Over his<br>\r\n",

      "of how many false mourners hath the dead. But Graspum would have all<br>\r\n",
      "such expressions shrink beneath his glowing goodness. With honied<br>\r\n",
      "words he tells the tale of his own honesty: his business intercourse<br>\r\n",
      "with the deceased was in character most generous. Many a good turn<br>\r\n",
      "did Marston receive at his hands; long had he been his faithful and<br>\r\n",
      "unwearied friend. Fierce are the words with which he would execrate<br>\r\n",
      "the tyrant creditors; yea, he would heap condign punishment on their<br>\r\n",
      "obdurate heads. Time after time did he tell them the fallen man was<br>\r\n",
      "penniless; how strange, then, that they tortured him to death within<br>\r\n",
      "prison walls. He would sweep away such vengeance, bury it with his<br>\r\n",
      "curses, and make obsolete such laws as give one man power to gratify<br>\r\n",
      "his passion on another. His burning, surging anger can find no<br>\r\n",

      "into the city. He will prepare to obey the summons, Dan and Sprat<br>\r\n",
      "meanwhile taking good care of the horse and carriage, while Bradshaw<br>\r\n",
      "makes a friendly visit to a few of the more distinguished cabins,<br>\r\n",
      "and says \"how de\" to venerable aunties, who spread their best fare<br>\r\n",
      "before him, and, with grave ceremony, invite him in to refresh<br>\r\n",
      "before taking his return journey into the city; and Maum Betsy packs<br>\r\n",
      "up six of her real smart made sweet cakes for the parson and<br>\r\n",
      "Bradshaw to eat along the road. Betsy is in a strange state of<br>\r\n",
      "bewilderment to know why master wants to take the new parson away<br>\r\n",
      "just now, when he's so happy, and is only satisfied when assured<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, what can master want with me?\" enquires Harry, as, on the<br>\r\n",

      "cunning wink in reply.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "It is three o'clock when they arrive at the Villa, where, without<br>\r\n",
      "reserve, missus extends her hand, and gives him a cordial<br>\r\n",
      "welcome,--tells him Franconia has been waiting to see him with great<br>\r\n",
      "patience, and has got a present for him. Franconia comes rushing<br>\r\n",
      "into the hall, and is so glad to see him; but her countenance wears<br>\r\n",
      "an air of sadness, which does not escape his notice-she is not the<br>\r\n",
      "beautiful creature she was years ago, care has sadly worn upon those<br>\r\n",
      "rounded features. But master is there, and he looks happy and<br>\r\n",
      "cheerful; and there is something about the house servants, as they<br>\r\n",
      "gather round him to have their say, which looks of suspiciously good<br>\r\n",
      "omen. He cannot divine what it is; his first suspicions being<br>\r\n",
      "aroused by missus saying Franconia had been waiting to see him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We must not call him Harry any longer-it doesn't become his<br>\r\n",
      "profession: now that he is Elder of my plantation flock, he must,<br>\r\n",
      "from this time, be called Elder!\" says Rosebrook, touching him on<br>\r\n",
      "the arm with the right hand. And the two ladies joined in, that it<br>\r\n",
      "must be so. \"Go into the parlour, ladies; I must say a word or two<br>\r\n",
      "to the Elder,\" continued Rosebrook, taking Harry by the arm, and<br>\r\n",
      "pacing through the hall into the conservatory at the back of the<br>\r\n",
      "house. Here, after ordering Harry to be seated, he recounts his plan<br>\r\n",
      "of emancipation, which, so far, has worked admirably, and, at the<br>\r\n",
      "time proposed, will, without doubt or danger, produce the hoped-for<br>\r\n",
      "result. \"You, my good man,\" he says, \"can be a useful instrument in<br>\r\n",
      "furthering my ends; I want you to be that instrument!\" His negroes<br>\r\n",
      "have all an interest in their labour, which interest is preserved<br>\r\n",
      "for them in missus's savings-bank; and at a given time they are to<br>\r\n",
      "have their freedom, but to remain on the plantation if they choose,<br>\r\n",
      "at a stipulated rate of wages. Indeed, so strongly impressed with<br>\r\n",
      "the good results of his proposed system is Rosebrook, that he long<br>\r\n",
      "since scouted that contemptible fallacy, which must have had its<br>\r\n",
      "origin in the very dregs of selfishness, that the two races can only<br>\r\n",
      "live in proximity by one enslaving the other. Justice to each other,<br>\r\n",
      "he holds, will solve the problem of their living together; but,<br>\r\n",
      "between the oppressor and the oppressed, a volcano that may at any<br>\r\n",
      "day send forth its devouring flame, smoulders. Rosebrook knows<br>\r\n",
      "goodness always deserves its reward; and Harry assures him he never<br>\r\n",
      "will violate the trust. Having said thus much, he rises from his<br>\r\n",
      "chair, takes Harry by the arm, and leading him to the door of the<br>\r\n",
      "conservatory, points him to a passage leading to the right, and<br>\r\n",
      "says: \"In there!-proceed into that passage, enter a door, first door<br>\r\n",
      "on the left, and then you will find something you may consider your<br>\r\n",
      "own.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Harry hesitated for a moment, watched master's countenance<br>\r\n",
      "doubtingly, as if questioning the singular command.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Fear not! nobody will hurt you,\" continues Rosebrook.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Master never had a bad intention,\" thinks Harry; \"I know he would<br>\r\n",
      "not harm me; and then missus is so good.\" Slowly and nervously he<br>\r\n",
      "proceeds, and on reaching the door hears a familiar \"come in\"<br>\r\n",
      "answering his nervous rap. The door opened into a neat little room,<br>\r\n",
      "with carpet and chairs, a mahogany bureau and prints, all so neatly<br>\r\n",
      "arranged, and wearing such an air of cleanliness. No sooner has he<br>\r\n",
      "advanced beyond the threshold than the emaciated figure of a black<br>\r\n",
      "sister vaults into his arms, crying, \"Oh Harry! Harry! Harry!-my<br>\r\n",
      "dear husband!\" She throws her arms about his neck, and kisses, and<br>\r\n",
      "kisses him, and buries her tears of joy in his bosom. How she pours<br>\r\n",
      "out her soul's love!-how, in rapturous embraces, her black impulses<br>\r\n",
      "give out the purest affection!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"And you!-you!-you!-my own dear Jane! Is it you? Has God commanded<br>\r\n",
      "us to meet once more, to be happy once more, to live as heaven hath<br>\r\n",
      "ordained us to live?\" he returns, as fervently and affectionately he<br>\r\n",
      "holds her in his arms, and returns her token of love. \"Never! never!<br>\r\n",
      "I forget you, never! By night and by day I have prayed the<br>\r\n",
      "protecting hand of Providence to guide you through life's trials.<br>\r\n",
      "How my heart has yearned to meet you in heaven! happy am I we have<br>\r\n",
      "met once more on earth; yea, my soul leaps with joy. Forgive them,<br>\r\n",
      "Father, forgive them who separate us on earth, for heaven makes the<br>\r\n",
      "anointed!\" And while they embrace thus fondly, their tears mingling<br>\r\n",
      "with joy, children, recognising a returned father as he entered the<br>\r\n",
      "door, are clinging at his feet beseechingly. He is their father;--how<br>\r\n",
      "like children they love! \"Sam, Sue, and Beckie, too!\" he says, as<br>\r\n",
      "one by one he takes them in his arms and kisses them. But there are<br>\r\n",
      "two more, sombre and strange. He had caught the fourth in his arms,<br>\r\n",
      "unconsciously. \"Ah, Jane!\" he exclaims, turning toward her, his face<br>\r\n",
      "filled with grief and chagrin, \"they are not of me, Jane!\" He still<br>\r\n",
      "holds the little innocent by the hand, as nervously he waits her<br>\r\n",
      "reply. It is not guilt, but shame, with which she returns an answer.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"It was not my sin, Harry! It was him that forced me to live with<br>\r\n",
      "another,--that lashed me when I refused, and, bleeding, made me obey<br>\r\n",
      "the will,\" she returns, looking at him imploringly. Virtue is weaker<br>\r\n",
      "than the lash; none feel it more than the slave. She loved Harry,<br>\r\n",
      "she followed him with her thoughts; but it was the Christian that<br>\r\n",
      "reduced her to the level of the brute. Laying her coloured hand upon<br>\r\n",
      "his shoulder, she besought his forgiveness, as God was forgiving.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Why should I not forgive thee, Jane? I would not chide thee, for no<br>\r\n",
      "sin is on thy garments. Injustice gave master the right to sell<br>\r\n",
      "thee, to make of thee what he pleased. Heaven made thy soul<br>\r\n",
      "purest,--man thy body an outcast for the unrighteous to feast upon.<br>\r\n",
      "How could I withhold forgiveness, Jane? I will be a father to them,<br>\r\n",
      "a husband to thee; for what thou hast been compelled to do is right,<br>\r\n",
      "in the land we live in.\" So saying, he again embraces her, wipes the<br>\r\n",
      "tears from her eyes, and comforts her. How sweet is forgiveness! It<br>\r\n",
      "freshens like the dew of morning on the drooping plant; it<br>\r\n",
      "strengthens the weary spirit, it steals into the desponding soul,<br>\r\n",
      "and wakes to life new hopes of bliss,--to the slave it is sweet<br>\r\n",
      "indeed!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I will kiss them, too,\" he ejaculates, taking them in his arms with<br>\r\n",
      "the embrace of a fond father,--which simple expression of love they<br>\r\n",
      "return with prattling. They know not the trials of their parents;<br>\r\n",
      "how blessed to know them not!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "And now they gather the children around them, and seat themselves on<br>\r\n",
      "a little settee near the window, where Harry, overjoyed at meeting<br>\r\n",
      "his dear ones once more, fondles them and listens to Jane, as with<br>\r\n",
      "her left arm round his neck she discloses the sad tale of her<br>\r\n",
      "tribulation. Let us beg the reader to excuse the recital; there is<br>\r\n",
      "nothing fascinating in it, nor would we call forth the modest<br>\r\n",
      "blushes of our generous south. A few words of the woman's story,<br>\r\n",
      "however, we cannot omit; and we trust the forgiving will pardon<br>\r\n",
      "their insertion. She tells Harry she was not separated from her<br>\r\n",
      "children; but that Romescos, having well considered her worth, sold<br>\r\n",
      "her with her \"young uns\" to the Rev. Peter--, who had a small<br>\r\n",
      "plantation down in Christ's Parish. The reverend gentleman, being<br>\r\n",
      "born and educated to the degrading socialities of democratic states,<br>\r\n",
      "always says he is not to blame for \"using\" the rights the law gives<br>\r\n",
      "him; nor does he forget to express sundry regrets that he cannot see<br>\r\n",
      "as preachers at the north see. As for money, he thinks preachers<br>\r\n",
      "have just as good a right to get it as gentlemen of any other<br>\r\n",
      "honourable profession. Now and then he preaches to niggers; and for<br>\r\n",
      "telling them how they must live in the fear of the Lord, be obedient<br>\r\n",
      "to their master, and pay for redemption by the sweat of their brows,<br>\r\n",
      "he adds to his pile of coin. But he is strongly of the opinion that<br>\r\n",
      "niggers are inferior \"brutes\" of the human species, and in<br>\r\n",
      "furtherance of this opinion (so popular in the whole south) he<br>\r\n",
      "expects them to live a week on a peck of corn. As for Jane-we must<br>\r\n",
      "excuse the reverend gentleman, because of his faith in southern<br>\r\n",
      "principles-he compelled her to live with the man Absalom ere she had<br>\r\n",
      "been two days on his plantation, and by the same Absalom she had two<br>\r\n",
      "children, which materially increased the cash value of the Reverend<br>\r\n",
      "Peter--'s slave property. Indeed, so well is the reverend gentleman<br>\r\n",
      "known for his foul play, that it has been thrown up to him in open<br>\r\n",
      "court-by wicked planters who never had the fear of God before their<br>\r\n",
      "eyes-that he more than half starved his niggers, and charged them<br>\r\n",
      "toll for grinding their corn in his mill. Though the Reverend Peter<br>\r\n",
      "--never failed to assure his friends and acquaintances of his<br>\r\n",
      "generosity (a noble quality which had long been worthily maintained<br>\r\n",
      "by the ancient family to which he belonged), the light of one<br>\r\n",
      "generous act had never found its way to the public. In truth, so<br>\r\n",
      "elastically did his reverend conscientiousness expand when he<br>\r\n",
      "learned the strange motive which prompted Rosebrook to purchase Jane<br>\r\n",
      "and her little ones, that he sorely regretted he had not put two<br>\r\n",
      "hundred dollars more on the price of the lot. Fortunately Jane was<br>\r\n",
      "much worn down by grief and toil, and was viewed by the reverend<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman as a piece of property he would rather like to dispose of<br>\r\n",
      "to the best advantage, lest she should suddenly make a void in his<br>\r\n",
      "dollars and cents by sliding into some out of the way grave-yard.<br>\r\n",
      "But Rosebrook, duly appreciating the unchristian qualities of our<br>\r\n",
      "worthy one's generosity, kept his motive a profound secret until the<br>\r\n",
      "negociation was completed. Now that it had become known that the<br>\r\n",

      "or tie her up every day and pump her with cold water, say fifteen<br>\r\n",
      "minutes at a time. Pumping niggers, the elder Mr. Choicewest<br>\r\n",
      "remarks, with the coolness of an Austrian diplomatist, has a<br>\r\n",
      "wondrous effect upon them; \"it makes 'em give in when nothing else<br>\r\n",
      "will.\" He once had four prime fellows, who, in stubbornness, seemed<br>\r\n",
      "a match for Mr. Beelzebub himself. He lashed them, and he burned<br>\r\n",
      "them, and he clipped their ears; and then he stretched them on<br>\r\n",
      "planks, thinking they would cry \"give in\" afore the sockets of their<br>\r\n",
      "joints were drawn out; but it was all to no purpose, they were as<br>\r\n",
      "unyielding as granite.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "About that time there was a celebrated manager of negroes keeping<br>\r\n",
      "the prison. This clever functionary had a peculiar way of bringing<br>\r\n",
      "the stubbornness out of them; so he consigned the four unbending<br>\r\n",
      "rascals to his skill. And this very valuable and very skilful<br>\r\n",
      "gaol-keeper had a large window in his establishment, with iron bars<br>\r\n",
      "running perpendicular; to the inside of which he would strap the<br>\r\n",
      "four stubborn rascals, with their faces scientifically arranged<br>\r\n",
      "between the bars, to prevent the moving of a muscle. Thus caged,<br>\r\n",
      "their black heads bound to the grating, the scientific gaoler, who<br>\r\n",
      "was something of a humourist withal, would enjoy a nice bit of fun<br>\r\n",
      "at seeing the more favoured prisoners (with his kind permission)<br>\r\n",
      "exercise their dexterity in throwing peas at the faces of the<br>\r\n",
      "bounden. How he would laugh-how the pea-punishing prisoners would<br>\r\n",
      "enjoy it-how the fast bound niggers, foaming with rage and maddened<br>\r\n",
      "to desperation, would bellow, as their very eyeballs darted fire and<br>\r\n",
      "blood! What grand fun it was! bull-baiting sank into a mere shadow<br>\r\n",
      "beside it. The former was measuredly passive, because the bull only<br>\r\n",
      "roared, and pitched, and tossed; whereas here the sport was made<br>\r\n",
      "more exhilarating by expressions of vengeance or implorings. And<br>\r\n",
      "then, as a change of pastime, the skilful gaoler would demand a<br>\r\n",
      "cessation of the pea hostilities, and enjoin the commencement of the<br>\r\n",
      "water war; which said war was carried out by supplying about a dozen<br>\r\n",
      "prisoners with as many buckets, which they would fill with great<br>\r\n",
      "alacrity, and, in succession, throw the contents with great force<br>\r\n",
      "over the unyielding, from the outside. The effect of this on naked<br>\r\n",
      "men, bound with chains to iron bars, may be imagined; but the older<br>\r\n",
      "Choicewest declares it was a cure. It brought steel out of the<br>\r\n",
      "\"rascals,\" and made them as submissive as shoe-strings. Sometimes<br>\r\n",
      "the jolly prisoners would make the bath so strong, that the niggers<br>\r\n",
      "would seem completely drowned when released; but then they'd soon<br>\r\n",
      "come to with a jolly good rolling, a little hartshorn applied to<br>\r\n",
      "their nostrils, and the like of that. About a dozen times putting<br>\r\n",
      "through the pea and water process cured them.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "So says the very respectable Mr. Choicewest, with great dignity of<br>\r\n",
      "manners, as he seriously advises the younger Choicewest to try a<br>\r\n",
      "little quantity of the same sort on his now useless female purchase.<br>\r\n",
      "Lady Choicewest must, however, be consulted on this point, as she is<br>\r\n",
      "very particular about the mode in which all females about her<br>\r\n",
      "establishment are chastised. Indeed, Lady Choicewest is much<br>\r\n",
      "concerned about the only male, heir of the family, to whom she looks<br>\r\n",
      "forward for very distinguished results to the family name. The<br>\r\n",
      "family (Lady Choicewest always assures those whom she graciously<br>\r\n",
      "condescends to admit into the fashionable precincts of her small but<br>\r\n",
      "very select circle), descended from the very ancient and chivalric<br>\r\n",
      "house of that name, whose celebrated estate was in Warwickshire,<br>\r\n",
      "England; and, in proof of this, my Lady Choicewest invariably points<br>\r\n",
      "to a sad daub, illustrative of some incomprehensible object,<br>\r\n",
      "suspended over the antique mantelpiece. With methodical grace, and<br>\r\n",
      "dignity which frowns with superlative contempt upon every thing very<br>\r\n",
      "vulgar--for she says \"she sublimely detests them very low creatures<br>\r\n",
      "what are never brought up to manners at the north, and are worse<br>\r\n",
      "than haystacks to larn civility\"--my lady solicits a near inspection<br>\r\n",
      "of this wonderful hieroglyphic, which she tells us is the family<br>\r\n",
      "arms,--an ancient and choice bit of art she would not part with for<br>\r\n",
      "the world. If her friends evince any want of perception in tracing<br>\r\n",
      "the many deeds of valour it heralds, on behalf of the noble family<br>\r\n",
      "of which she is an undisputed descendant, my lady will at once enter<br>\r\n",
      "upon the task of instruction; and with the beautiful fore-finger of<br>\r\n",
      "her right hand, always jewelled with great brilliancy, will she<br>\r\n",
      "satisfactorily enlighten the stupid on the fame of the ancient<br>\r\n",
      "Choicewest family, thereon inscribed. With no ordinary design on the<br>\r\n",
      "credulity of her friends, Lady Choicewest has several times strongly<br>\r\n",
      "intimated that she was not quite sure that one or two of her<br>\r\n",
      "ancestors in the male line of the family were not reigning dukes as<br>\r\n",
      "far down as the noble reign of the ignoble Oliver Cromwell! The<br>\r\n",
      "question, nevertheless, is whether the honour of the ancient<br>\r\n",
      "Choicewest family descended from Mr. or Mrs. Choicewest. The vulgar<br>\r\n",
      "mass have been known to say (smilingly) that Lady Choicewest's name<br>\r\n",
      "was Brown, the father of which very ancient family sold herrings and<br>\r\n",
      "small pigs at a little stand in the market: this, however, was a<br>\r\n",
      "very long time ago, and, as my lady is known to be troubled with an<br>\r\n",
      "exceedingly crooked memory, persons better acquainted with her are<br>\r\n",
      "more ready to accept the oblivious excuse.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Taking all these things into consideration, my Lady Choicewest is<br>\r\n",
      "exceedingly cautious lest young Gourdoin Choicewest should do aught<br>\r\n",
      "to dishonour the family name; and on this strange perplexity in<br>\r\n",
      "which her much indulged son is placed being referred to her, she<br>\r\n",
      "gives it as her most decided opinion that the wench, if as obstinate<br>\r\n",
      "as described, had better be sold to the highest bidder-the sooner<br>\r\n",
      "the better. My lady lays great emphasis on \"the sooner the better.\"<br>\r\n",
      "That something will be lost she has not the slightest doubt; but<br>\r\n",
      "then it were better to lose a little in the price of the stubborn<br>\r\n",
      "wretch, than to have her always creating disturbance about the<br>\r\n",
      "genteel premises. In furtherance of this-my lady's mandate-Annette<br>\r\n",
      "is sold to Mr. Blackmore Blackett for the nice round sum of fifteen<br>\r\n",
      "hundred dollars. Gourdoin Choicewest hates to part with the beauty,<br>\r\n",
      "grieves and regrets,--she is so charmingly fascinating. \"Must let her<br>\r\n",
      "slide, though; critter won't do at all as I wants her to,\" he lisps,<br>\r\n",
      "regretting the serious loss of the dollars. His friend Blackmore<br>\r\n",
      "Blackett, however, is a gentleman, and therefore he would not<br>\r\n",
      "deceive him in the wench: hence he makes the reduction, because he<br>\r\n",
      "finds her decidedly faulty. Had Blackmore Blackett been a regular<br>\r\n",
      "flesh trader, he would not have scrupled to take him in. As it is,<br>\r\n",
      "gentlemen must always be gentlemen among themselves. Blackett, a<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman of fortune, who lives at his ease in the city, and has the<br>\r\n",
      "very finest taste for female beauty, was left, most unfortunately, a<br>\r\n",
      "widower with four lovely daughters, any one of which may be<br>\r\n",
      "considered a belle not to be rung by gentlemen of ordinary rank or<br>\r\n",
      "vulgar pretension. In fact, the Blackett girls are considered very<br>\r\n",
      "fine specimens of beauty, are much admired in society, and expect<br>\r\n",
      "ere long, on the clear merit of polish, to rank equal with the first<br>\r\n",
      "aristocracy of the place.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Blackmore Blackett esteems himself an extremely lucky fellow in<br>\r\n",
      "having so advantageously procured such a nice piece of property,--so<br>\r\n",
      "suited to his taste. Her price, when compared with her singularly<br>\r\n",
      "valuable charms, is a mere nothing; and, too, all his fashionable<br>\r\n",
      "friends will congratulate him upon his good fortune. But as<br>\r\n",
      "disappointments will come, so Mr. Blackmore Blackett finds he has<br>\r\n",
      "got something not quite so valuable as anticipated; however, being<br>\r\n",
      "something of a philosopher, he will improve upon the course pursued<br>\r\n",
      "by the younger Choicewest: he makes his first advances with great<br>\r\n",
      "caution; whispers words of tenderness in her ear; tells her his<br>\r\n",
      "happy jewel for life she must be. Remembering her mother, she turns<br>\r\n",
      "a deaf ear to Mr. Blackett's pleadings. The very cabin which he has<br>\r\n",
      "provided for her in the yard reminds her of that familiar domicile<br>\r\n",
      "on Marston's plantation. Neither by soft pleadings, nor threatenings<br>\r\n",
      "of sale to plantation life, nor terrors of the lash, can he soften<br>\r\n",
      "the creature's sympathies, so that the flesh may succumb. When he<br>\r\n",
      "whispered soft words and made fascinating promises, she would shake<br>\r\n",
      "her head and move from him; when he threatened, she would plead her<br>\r\n",
      "abject position; when he resorted to force, she would struggle with<br>\r\n",
      "him, making the issue her virtue or death. Once she paid the penalty<br>\r\n",
      "of her struggles with a broken wrist, which she shows us more in<br>\r\n",
      "sorrow than anger. Annette is beautiful but delicate; has soft eyes<br>\r\n",
      "beaming with the fulness of a great soul; but they were sold,<br>\r\n",
      "once,--now, sympathy for her is dead. The law gives her no protection<br>\r\n",
      "for her virtue; the ruffian may violate it, and Heaven only can<br>\r\n",
      "shelter it with forgiveness. As for Blackett, he has no forgiveness<br>\r\n",
      "in his temperament,--passion soars highest with him; he would slay<br>\r\n",
      "with violent hands the minion who dared oppose its triumph.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "About this time, Mr. Blackett, much to his surprise, finds a storm<br>\r\n",
      "of mischief brewing about his domestic domain. The Miss Blacketts,<br>\r\n",
      "dashing beauties, have had it come to their ears over and over again<br>\r\n",
      "that all the young men about the city say Annette Mazatlin (as she<br>\r\n",
      "is now called) is far more beautiful than any one of the Blacketts.<br>\r\n",
      "This is quite enough to kindle the elements of a female war. In the<br>\r\n",
      "south nothing can spread the war of jealousy and vanity with such<br>\r\n",
      "undying rage as comparing slave beauty with that of the more<br>\r\n",
      "favoured of the sexes. A firman of the strongest kind is now issued<br>\r\n",
      "from the portfolio of the Miss Blacketts, forbidding the wretched<br>\r\n",
      "girl entering the house; and storms of abuse are plentifully and<br>\r\n",
      "very cheaply lavished on her head, ere she puts it outside the<br>\r\n",
      "cabin. She was a nasty, impudent hussy; the very worst of all kind<br>\r\n",
      "of creatures to have about a respectable mansion,--enough to shock<br>\r\n",
      "respectable people! The worst of it was, that the miserable white<br>\r\n",
      "nigger thought she was handsome, and a lot of young, silly-headed<br>\r\n",
      "men flattered her vanity by telling the fool she was prettier than<br>\r\n",
      "the Blacketts themselves,--so said the very accomplished Miss<br>\r\n",
      "Blacketts. And if ever domicile was becoming too warm for man to<br>\r\n",
      "live in, in consequence of female indignation, that one was Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Blackmore Blackett's. It was not so much that the father had<br>\r\n",
      "purchased this beautiful creature to serve fiendish purposes. Oh<br>\r\n",
      "no!-that was a thing of every-day occurrence,--something excusable in<br>\r\n",
      "any respectable man's family. It was beauty rivalling, fierce and<br>\r\n",
      "jealous of its compliments. Again, the wretch-found incorrigible,<br>\r\n",
      "and useless for the purpose purchased-is sold. Poor, luckless<br>\r\n",
      "maiden! she might add, as she passed through the hands of so many<br>\r\n",
      "purchasers. This time, however, she is less valuable from having<br>\r\n",
      "fractured her left wrist, deformity being always taken into account<br>\r\n",
      "when such property is up at the flesh shambles. But Mr. Blackmore<br>\r\n",
      "Blackett has a delicacy about putting her up under the hammer just<br>\r\n",
      "now, inasmuch as he could not say she was sold for no fault; while<br>\r\n",
      "the disfigured wrist might lead to suspicious remarks concerning his<br>\r\n",
      "treatment of her. Another extremely unfortunate circumstance was its<br>\r\n",
      "getting all about the city that she was a cold, soulless thing, who<br>\r\n",
      "declared that sooner than yield to be the abject wretch men sought<br>\r\n",
      "to make her, she would die that only death. She had but one life,<br>\r\n",
      "and it were better to yield that up virtuously than die degraded.<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum, then, is the only safe channel in which to dispose of the<br>\r\n",
      "like. That functionary assures Mr. Blackmore Blackett that the girl<br>\r\n",
      "is beautiful, delicate, and an exceedingly sweet creature yet! but<br>\r\n",
      "that during the four months she has depreciated more than fifty per<br>\r\n",
      "cent in value. His remarks may be considered out of place, but they<br>\r\n",
      "are none the less true, for it is ascertained, on private<br>\r\n",
      "examination, that sundry stripes have been laid about her bare<br>\r\n",
      "loins. Gurdoin Choicewest declared to his mother that he never for<br>\r\n",
      "once had laid violent hands on the obstinate wench; Mr. Blackmore<br>\r\n",
      "Blackett stood ready to lay his hand on the Bible, and lift his eyes<br>\r\n",
      "to heaven for proof of his innocence; but a record of the<br>\r\n",
      "infliction, indelible of blood, remained there to tell its sad<br>\r\n",
      "tale,--to shame, if shame had aught in slavery whereon to make itself<br>\r\n",
      "known. Notwithstanding this bold denial, it is found that Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Blackmore Blackett did on two occasions strip her and secure her<br>\r\n",
      "hands and feet to the bed-post, where he put on \"about six at a<br>\r\n",
      "time,\" remarkably \"gently.\" He admired her symmetrical form, her<br>\r\n",
      "fine, white, soft, smooth skin-her voluptuous limbs, so beautifully<br>\r\n",
      "and delicately developed; and then there was so much gushing<br>\r\n",
      "sweetness, mingled with grief, in her face, as she cast her soft<br>\r\n",
      "glances upon him, and implored him to end her existence, or save her<br>\r\n",
      "such shame! Such, he says, laconically, completely disarmed him, and<br>\r\n",
      "he only switched her a few times.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"She's not worth a dot more than a thousand dollars. I couldn't give<br>\r\n",
      "it for her, because I couldn't make it out on her. The fact is,<br>\r\n",
      "she'll get a bad name by passing through so many hands-a deuced bad<br>\r\n",
      "name!\" says Graspum, whose commercial language is politically cold.<br>\r\n",
      "\"And then there's her broken wrist-doubtful! doubtful! doubtful!<br>\r\n",
      "what I can do with her. For a plantation she isn't worth seven<br>\r\n",
      "coppers, and sempstresses and housemaids of her kind are looked on<br>\r\n",
      "suspiciously. It's only with great nicety of skill ye can work such<br>\r\n",
      "property to advantage,\" he continues, viewing her in one of Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Blackmore Blackett's ante-rooms.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The upshot of the matter is, that Mr. Blackmore Blackett accepts the<br>\r\n",
      "offer, and Graspum, having again taken the damaged property under<br>\r\n",
      "his charge, sends it back to his pen. As an offset for the broken<br>\r\n",
      "wrist, she has three new dresses, two of which were presented by the<br>\r\n",
      "younger Choicewest, and one by the generous Blackmore Blackett.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Poor Annette! she leaves for her home in the slave-pen, sad at<br>\r\n",
      "heart, and in tears. \"My mother! Oh, that I had a mother to love me,<br>\r\n",
      "to say Annette so kindly,--to share with me my heart's bitter<br>\r\n",
      "anguish. How I could love Nicholas, now that there is no mother to<br>\r\n",
      "love me!\" she mutters as she sobs, wending her way to that place of<br>\r\n",
      "earthly torment. How different are the feelings of the oppressor. He<br>\r\n",
      "drinks a social glass of wine with his friend Blackett, lights his<br>\r\n",
      "cigar most fashionably, bids him a polite good morning, and<br>\r\n",
      "intimates that a cheque for the amount of the purchase will be ready<br>\r\n",
      "any time he may be pleased to call. And now he wends his way<br>\r\n",
      "homeward, little imagining what good fortune awaits him at the pen<br>\r\n",
      "to which he has despatched his purchase.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Annette has reached the pen, in which she sits, pensively, holding<br>\r\n",
      "her bonnet by the strings, the heavy folds of her light auburn hair<br>\r\n",
      "hanging dishevelled over her shoulders. Melancholy indeed she is,<br>\r\n",
      "for she has passed an ordeal of unholy brutality. Near her sits one<br>\r\n",
      "Pringle Blowers, a man of coarse habits, who resides on his<br>\r\n",
      "rice-plantation, a few miles from the city, into which he frequently<br>\r\n",
      "comes, much to the annoyance of quietly disposed citizens and<br>\r\n",
      "guardsmen, who are not unfrequently called upon to preserve the<br>\r\n",
      "peace he threatens to disturb. Dearly does he love his legitimate<br>\r\n",
      "brandy, and dearly does it make him pay for the insane frolics it<br>\r\n",
      "incites him to perpetrate, to the profit of certain saloons, and<br>\r\n",
      "danger of persons. Madman under the influence of his favourite<br>\r\n",
      "drink, a strange pride besets his faculties, which is only appeased<br>\r\n",
      "with the demolition of glass and men's faces. For this strange<br>\r\n",
      "amusement he has become famous and feared; and as the light of his<br>\r\n",
      "own besotted countenance makes its appearance, citizens generally<br>\r\n",
      "are not inclined to interpose any obstacle to the exercise of his<br>\r\n",
      "belligerent propensities.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Here he sits, viewing Annette with excited scrutiny. Never before<br>\r\n",
      "has he seen anything so pretty, so bright, so fascinating-all<br>\r\n",
      "clothed with a halo of modesty-for sale in the market. The nigger is<br>\r\n",
      "completely absorbed in the beauty, he mutters to himself: and yet<br>\r\n",
      "she must be a nigger or she would not be here. That she is an<br>\r\n",
      "article of sale, then, there can be no doubt. \"Van, yer the nicest<br>\r\n",

      "\"I am not for you, man!\" she interrupts: \"I would scorn you, were I<br>\r\n",
      "not enslaved,\" she continues, a curl of contempt on her lip, as her<br>\r\n",
      "very soul kindles with grief. Rising quickly from his side she<br>\r\n",
      "walked across the pen, and seated herself on the opposite side. Here<br>\r\n",
      "she casts a frowning look upon him, as if loathing his very<br>\r\n",
      "presence. This, Mr. Pringle Blowers don't altogether like: slaves<br>\r\n",
      "have no right to look loathingly on white people. His flushed face<br>\r\n",
      "glows red with excitement; he runs his brawny fingers through the<br>\r\n",
      "tufted mats of short curly hair that stand almost erect on his head,<br>\r\n",
      "draws his capacious jaws into a singular angle, and makes a hideous<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The terrified girl has no answer to make; she is a forlorn outcast<br>\r\n",
      "of democracy's rule. He takes the black ribbon from round his neck,<br>\r\n",
      "bares his bosom more broadly than before, throws the plaid sack in<br>\r\n",
      "which he is dressed from off him, and leaping as it were across the<br>\r\n",
      "room, seizes her in his arms. \"Kisses are cheap, I reckon, and a<br>\r\n",
      "feller what don't have enough on 'em 's a fool,\" he ejaculates, as<br>\r\n",
      "with a desperate struggle she bounds from his grasp, seizes the<br>\r\n",
      "knife from a negro's hand as she passes him, and is about to plunge<br>\r\n",
      "the shining steel into her breast. \"Oh, mother, mother!-what have I<br>\r\n",
      "done?-is not God my Saviour?-has he forsaken me?-left me a prey to<br>\r\n",
      "those who seek my life?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I settle those things,\" said a voice in the rear, and immediately a<br>\r\n",
      "hand grasped her arm, and the knife fell carelessly upon the floor.<br>\r\n",
      "It was Graspum; the sudden surprise overcame her; she sank back in<br>\r\n",
      "his arms, and swooned. \"She swoons,--how limber, how lifeless she<br>\r\n",
      "seems!\" says Graspum, as with great coolness he calls a negro<br>\r\n",
      "attendant, orders him to remove her to the grass plat, and bathe her<br>\r\n",
      "well with cold water. \"A good dowsing of water is the cure for<br>\r\n",
      "fainting niggers,\" he concludes.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The black man takes her in his arms, and with great kindness, lays<br>\r\n",
      "her on the plat, bathes her temples, loosens her dress, and with his<br>\r\n",
      "rough hand manipulates her arms. How soft and silky they seem to his<br>\r\n",
      "touch! \"Him hard to slave ye, miss,\" he says, laying his hand upon<br>\r\n",
      "her temples, gently, as with commiseration he looks intently on her<br>\r\n",
      "pallid features.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Now, Blowers,\" says Graspum, as soon as they are by themselves,<br>\r\n",
      "\"what in the name of the Gentiles have you been up to?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Wal-can't say its nothin, a'cos that wouldn't do. But, ye see, the<br>\r\n",
      "critter made my mouth water so; there was no standin on't! And I<br>\r\n",
      "wanted to be civil, and she wouldn't,--and I went t' fumlin with her<br>\r\n",
      "hair what looked so inviting, as there was no resistin on't, and she<br>\r\n",
      "looked just as sassy as sixty; and to stun the whole, when I only<br>\r\n",
      "wanted to kiss them ar' temptin lips, the fool was going to kill<br>\r\n",
      "herself. It wasn't how I cared two buttons about it; but then the<br>\r\n",
      "feelin just came over me at the time,\" he answers, shaking his huge<br>\r\n",
      "sides, giving Graspum a significant wink, and laughing heartily.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Never at a loss, I see!\" returns the other, nodding his head,<br>\r\n",
      "pertinently: \"If I didn't know ye, Blowers, that might go down<br>\r\n",
      "without sticking.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ye don't tell where ye raised that critter, eh?\" he interrupts,<br>\r\n",
      "inquisitively, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder, and<br>\r\n",
      "crooking his finger, comically.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Raised her with shiners-lots on 'em!\" he rejoins, pushing Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Pringle Blowers in the stomach, playfully, with his forefinger.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Graspum! yer a wicked 'un.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Suit ye, kind 'a-eh, Blowers?\" he rejoins, enquiringly, maintaining<br>\r\n",
      "great gravity of manner as he watches each change of Blowers'<br>\r\n",
      "countenance.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers laughs in reply. His laugh has something sardonic in it,<br>\r\n",
      "seeming more vicious as he opens his great wicked mouth, and<br>\r\n",
      "displays an ugly row of coloured teeth.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Sit down, Blowers, sit down!\" says Graspum, motioning his hand,<br>\r\n",
      "with a studied politeness. The two gentlemen take seats side by<br>\r\n",
      "side, on a wooden bench, stretched across the centre of the pen, for<br>\r\n",
      "negroes to sit upon. \"As I live, Blowers, thar ain't another<br>\r\n",
      "individual like you in the county. You can whip a file of common<br>\r\n",
      "guardsmen, put the Mayor's court through a course of affronts,<br>\r\n",
      "frighten all the females out of the fashionable houses, treat a<br>\r\n",
      "regiment of volunteers, drink a bar-room dry-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Compliments thick, long and strong,\" interposes Blowers, winking<br>\r\n",
      "and wiping his mouth. \"Can elect half the members of the assembly!\"<br>\r\n",
      "he concludes.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"True! nevertheless,\" rejoins Graspum, \"a great man cannot be<br>\r\n",
      "flattered-compliments are his by merit! And the city knows you're a<br>\r\n",
      "man of exquisite taste.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers interrupts with a loud laugh, as he suggests the propriety<br>\r\n",
      "of seeing the \"gal get round again.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not so fast, Blowers; not so fast!\" Graspum ejaculates, as Blowers<br>\r\n",
      "is about to rise from his seat and follow Annette.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well, now!\" returns Blowers, remaining seated, \"Might just as well<br>\r\n",
      "come square to the mark,--ye want to sell me that wench?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Truth's truth!\" he replies. \"Blowers is the man who's got the gold<br>\r\n",
      "to do it.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Name yer price; and no rounding the corners!\" exclaims Blowers, his<br>\r\n",
      "countenance quickening with animation. He takes Graspum by the arm<br>\r\n",
      "with his left hand, turns him half round, and waits for a reply.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Seeing it's Blowers, (the keen business man replies, in an off-hand<br>\r\n",
      "manner), who's a trump in his way, and don't care for a few dollars,<br>\r\n",
      "he'll take seventeen hundred for her, tin down; not a fraction less!<br>\r\n",
      "He will have no bantering, inasmuch as his friends all know that he<br>\r\n",
      "has but one price for niggers, from which it is no use to seek a<br>\r\n",
      "discount. Mr. Blowers, generally a good judge of such articles,<br>\r\n",
      "would like one more view at it before fully making up his mind.<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum calls \"Oh, boy!\" and the negro making his appearance, says:<br>\r\n",
      "\"Dat gal 'um all right agin; went mos asleep, but am right as<br>\r\n",
      "parched pen now.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Have her coming,\" he returns, facing Blowers. \"Nothing the matter<br>\r\n",
      "with that gal,\" he exclaims, touching his elbow. \"It is merely one of<br>\r\n",
      "her flimsy fits; she hasn't quite come to maturity.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Slowly the negro leads her, weeping (Graspum says they will cry-it's<br>\r\n",
      "natural!) into the presence of the far-famed and much-feared Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Pringle Blowers. Her hair hangs carelessly about her neck and<br>\r\n",
      "shoulders, the open incision of her dress discloses a neatly worked<br>\r\n",
      "stomacher; how sweetly glows the melancholy that broods over her<br>\r\n",
      "countenance! \"I'll take her-I'll take her!\" exclaims Blowers, in<br>\r\n",
      "spasmodic ecstasy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I know'd you would; I'll suit you to a charm,\" rejoins the man of<br>\r\n",
      "trade, laconically, as the negro steps a few feet backward, and<br>\r\n",
      "watches the process. \"Considers it a trade,\" is the reply of<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers, as he orders his waggon to be brought to the door.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Oh! master, master! save me-save me! and let me die in peace.<br>\r\n",
      "Don't, good master, don't sell me again!\" Thus saying she falls on<br>\r\n",
      "her knees at Graspum's feet, and with hands uplifted beseeches him<br>\r\n",
      "to save her from the hands of a man whose very sight she loathes.<br>\r\n",
      "She reads the man's character in his face; she knows too well the<br>\r\n",
      "hellish purpose for which he buys her. Bitter, bitter, are the tears<br>\r\n",
      "of anguish she sheds at his feet, deep and piercing are her<br>\r\n",
      "bemoanings. Again her soft, sorrowing eyes wander in prayer to<br>\r\n",
      "heaven: as Graspum is a husband, a brother, and a father,--whose<br>\r\n",
      "children are yet in the world's travel of uncertainty, she beseeches<br>\r\n",
      "him to save her from that man.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Don't be mad, girl,\" he says, pushing her hand from him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Frightened, eh? Make ye love me, yet! Why, gal, ye never had such a<br>\r\n",
      "master in the world as I'll be to ye. I lay I makes a lady on ye,<br>\r\n",
      "and lets ye have it all yer own way, afore a fortnight,\" he rejoins,<br>\r\n",
      "spreading his brawny arms over her, as she, in an attitude of<br>\r\n",
      "fright, vaults from beneath them, and, uttering a faint cry, glides<br>\r\n",
      "crouching into a corner of the pen. There is no protection for her<br>\r\n",
      "now; her weepings and implorings fall harmless on the slavedealer's<br>\r\n",
      "ears; heaven will protect her when earth knows her no more!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"There's two can play a game like that, gal!\" exclaims Blowers.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Rough play like that don't do with this ere citizen. Can just take<br>\r\n",
      "the vixen out on a dozen on ye as what don't know what's good for<br>\r\n",
      "'em.\" Blowers is evidently allowing his temper to get the better of<br>\r\n",
      "him. He stands a few feet from her, makes grim his florid face,<br>\r\n",
      "gesticulates his hands, and daringly advances toward her as the<br>\r\n",
      "negro announces the arrival of his waggon.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You must go with him, girl; stop working yourself into a fever;<br>\r\n",
      "stop it, I say,\" interposes Graspum, peremptorily. \"The waggon! the<br>\r\n",
      "waggon! the waggon! to carry me away, away;--never, never to return<br>\r\n",
      "and see my mother?\" she exclaims, as well nigh in convulsions she<br>\r\n",
      "shrieks, when Blowers grasps her in his arms (Graspum saying, be<br>\r\n",
      "gentle, Blowers), drags her to the door, and by force thrusts her<br>\r\n",
      "into the waggon, stifling her cries as on the road they drive<br>\r\n",
      "quickly away. As the last faint wail dies away, and the vehicle<br>\r\n",
      "bearing its victim disappears in the distance, we think how sweet is<br>\r\n",
      "liberty, how prone to injustice is man, how crushing of right are<br>\r\n",
      "democracy's base practices.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Does seem kind of hard; but it's a righteous good sale. Shouldn't<br>\r\n",
      "wonder if she played the same game on him she did with t'other two<br>\r\n",
      "fools. Get her back then, and sell her over again. Well! come now;<br>\r\n",
      "there's no great loss without-some-small-gain!\" says Graspum, as,<br>\r\n",
      "standing his prominent figure in the door of his man pen, he watches<br>\r\n",
      "the woman pass out of sight, thrusts his hands deep into his<br>\r\n",

      "we must here inform him that considerable change in the social<br>\r\n",
      "position of the younger Grabguy family has taken place since we left<br>\r\n",
      "them, which is some years ago. The elder Grabguy, who, it will be<br>\r\n",
      "remembered, was very distinguished as his Worship the Mayor of the<br>\r\n",
      "City (that also was some years ago), has departed this life, leaving<br>\r\n",
      "the present principal of the Grabguy family a large portion of his<br>\r\n",
      "estate, which, being mostly of \"nigger property,\" requires some<br>\r\n",
      "little transforming before it can be made to suit his more extended<br>\r\n",
      "business arrangements. This material addition to the already well-<br>\r\n",
      "reputed estate of Mr. Grabguy warrants his admittance into very<br>\r\n",
      "respectable, and, some say, rather distinguished society. Indeed, it<br>\r\n",
      "is more than whispered, that when the question of admitting Mr. and<br>\r\n",
      "Mrs. Grabguy to the membership of a very select circle, the saintly<br>\r\n",
      "cognomen of which is as indefinable as its system of selecting<br>\r\n",
      "members, or the angles presented by the nasal organs of a few ladies<br>\r\n",
      "when anything short of the very first families are proposed, there<br>\r\n",
      "were seven very fashionable ladies for, and only three against. The<br>\r\n",
      "greatest antagonist the Grabguys have to getting into the embrace of<br>\r\n",
      "this very select circle is Mrs. Chief Justice Pimpkins, a matronly<br>\r\n",
      "body of some fifty summers, who declares there can be no judge in<br>\r\n",
      "the world so clever as her own dear Pimpkins, and that society was<br>\r\n",
      "becoming so vulgar and coarse, and so many low people-whose English<br>\r\n",
      "was as hopefully bad as could be, and who never spoke when they<br>\r\n",
      "didn't impugn her risible nerves-were intruding themselves upon its<br>\r\n",
      "polished sanctity, that she felt more and more every day the<br>\r\n",
      "necessity of withdrawing entirely from it, and enjoying her own<br>\r\n",
      "exclusively distinguished self. In the case of Grabguy's admittance<br>\r\n",
      "to the St. Cecilia, my Lady Pimpkins-she is commonly called Lady<br>\r\n",
      "Chief Justice Pimpkins-had two most formidable black balls; the<br>\r\n",
      "first because Mrs. Grabguy's father was a bread-baker, and the<br>\r\n",
      "second that the present Grabguy could not be considered a gentleman<br>\r\n",
      "while he continued in mechanical business. Another serious objection<br>\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pimpkins would merely suggest as a preventive;--such people<br>\r\n",
      "were ill suited to mix with titled and other distinguished society!<br>\r\n",
      "But, Grabguy, to make up for the vexatious rejection, has got to be<br>\r\n",
      "an alderman, which is a step upward in the scale of his father's<br>\r\n",
      "attained distinction. There is nothing more natural, then, than that<br>\r\n",
      "Grabguy should seek his way up in the world, with the best means at<br>\r\n",
      "his hands; it is a worthy trait of human nature, and is as natural<br>\r\n",
      "to the slave. In this instance-when master and slave are both<br>\r\n",
      "incited to a noble purpose-Grabguy is a wealthy alderman, and<br>\r\n",
      "Nicholas-the whiter of the two-his abject slave. The master, a man<br>\r\n",
      "of meagre mind, and exceedingly avaricious, would make himself<br>\r\n",
      "distinguished in society; the slave, a mercurial being of<br>\r\n",
      "impassioned temper, whose mind is quickened by a sense of the<br>\r\n",
      "injustice that robs him of his rights, seeks only freedom and what<br>\r\n",

      "Let us again introduce the reader to Nicholas, as his manly figure,<br>\r\n",
      "marked with impressive features, stands before us, in Grabguy's<br>\r\n",
      "workshop. Tall, and finely formed, he has grown to manhood,<br>\r\n",
      "retaining all the quick fiery impulses of his race. Those black eyes<br>\r\n",
      "wandering irresistibly, that curl of contempt that sits upon his<br>\r\n",
      "lip, that stare of revenge that scowls beneath those heavy eyebrows,<br>\r\n",
      "and that hate of wrong that ever and anon pervades the whole, tell<br>\r\n",
      "how burns in his heart the elements of a will that would brave death<br>\r\n",
      "for its rights-that would bear unmoved the oppressor's lash-that<br>\r\n",
      "would embrace death rather than yield to perfidy. He tells us-\"I<br>\r\n",

      "a democratic bull-dog, the foreman said he paid a democratic<br>\r\n",
      "ten-dollar gold piece for. They used to say the only difference<br>\r\n",
      "between me and the dog was, that the dog could go where he pleased<br>\r\n",
      "without being lashed, and I couldn't. And the dog always got enough<br>\r\n",
      "to eat, and seemed a great favourite with everybody, whereas I got<br>\r\n",
      "only more kicks than cucumbers, didn't seem liked by anybody, and if<br>\r\n",

      "would make a great mechanic of me, and give me a chance to buy<br>\r\n",
      "myself. I didn't know what this \"buy myself\" meant, at first. But I<br>\r\n",
      "soon found out-he tells us he must speak with caution-that I must<br>\r\n",
      "pay so many hundred dollars afore I could be like other folks. The<br>\r\n",
      "kindness Mr. Grabguy at first exhibited for me didn't last long; he<br>\r\n",
      "soon began to kick me, and cuff me, and swear at me. And it 'pear'd<br>\r\n",
      "to me as if I never could please anybody, and so my feelings got so<br>\r\n",
      "embittered I didn't know what to do. I was put into the shop among<br>\r\n",

      "first; and from turning the grindstone-the men used to throw water<br>\r\n",
      "in my face when they ground their chisels, and their plane irons,<br>\r\n",
      "and axes and adzes-I was learned to saw, and to plain boards, and<br>\r\n",
      "then to mortice and frame, and make mouldings, and window-sashes,<br>\r\n",
      "and door-frames. When I could do all these, master used to say I was<br>\r\n",
      "bound to make a great workman, and, laughingly, would say I was the<br>\r\n",
      "most valuable property he ever owned. About this time I began to<br>\r\n",
      "find out how it was that the other white folks owned themselves and<br>\r\n",
      "master owned me; but then, if I said anything about it, master might<br>\r\n",
      "tie me up and lash me as he used to do; and so I remained quiet, but<br>\r\n",
      "kept up a thinking. By and by I got perfect at the carpenter's<br>\r\n",
      "trade, and I learned engineering; and when I had got engineering<br>\r\n",
      "perfect, I took a fancy for making stucco work and images. And<br>\r\n",
      "people said I learned wondrously fast, and was the best workman far<br>\r\n",
      "or near. Seeing these things, people used to be coming to me, and<br>\r\n",
      "talking to me about my value, and then end by wanting me to make<br>\r\n",
      "them specimens of stucco. I seemed liked by everybody who came to<br>\r\n",
      "see me, and good people had a kind word for me; but Mr. Grabguy was<br>\r\n",
      "very strict, and wouldn't allow me to do anything without his<br>\r\n",
      "permission. People said my work was perfect, and master said I was a<br>\r\n",
      "perfect piece of property; and it used to pain deep into my heart<br>\r\n",
      "when master spoke so. Well! I got to be a man, and when the foreman<br>\r\n",
      "got drunk master used to put me in his place. And after a while I<br>\r\n",
      "got to be foreman altogether: but I was a slave, they said, and men<br>\r\n",
      "wouldn't follow my directions when master was away; they all<br>\r\n",
      "acknowledged that I was a good workman, but said a nigger never<br>\r\n",
      "should be allowed to direct and order white people. That made my<br>\r\n",
      "very blood boil, as I grew older, because I was whiter than many of<br>\r\n",
      "them. However, submit was the word; and I bore up and trusted to<br>\r\n",
      "heaven for deliverance, hoping the day would come soon when its will<br>\r\n",
      "would be carried out. With my knowledge of mechanics increased a<br>\r\n",
      "love of learning, which almost amounted to a passion. They said it<br>\r\n",
      "was against the law for a nigger to read; but I was raised so far<br>\r\n",

      "happy recollections its familiar sound recalls: how it strengthens<br>\r\n",
      "his hopes of success in his mission. The negro tells him he is a<br>\r\n",
      "labourer on the wharf, and cannot leave to conduct him to an hotel;<br>\r\n",
      "he will, however, direct the stranger to a comfortable abode in<br>\r\n",
      "Church Street. It is quiet and unostentatious, but will serve his<br>\r\n",
      "purpose. Placing a piece of money in the negro's hand, he assures<br>\r\n",
      "him that he is his friend-has much need of his services-will pay him<br>\r\n",
      "well for their employment. He has equally aroused the negro's<br>\r\n",
      "curiosity; and, were it nothing more than satisfying that, he would<br>\r\n",
      "be faithful to his promise to call the same night at seven o'clock.<br>\r\n",
      "Precisely at that hour the negro will fulfil his engagement. The<br>\r\n",
      "stranger wends his way to Church Street, and up a narrow alley, on<br>\r\n",
      "the left hand side, finds comfortable apartments, as directed. Here<br>\r\n",
      "he makes his toilet, and sallies out to reconnoitre the city.<br>\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the little craft is entered at the custom-house as a<br>\r\n",
      "fruiter, bound from New Providence to New York, and put in for a<br>\r\n",
      "harbour. There is something suspicious about a fruiter putting in<br>\r\n",

      "inquiringly, as if doubting the object for which he has been<br>\r\n",
      "summoned. Abjectly he holds his tattered cap in his hand, and<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Have confidence, my good fellow,\" the stranger speaks, with a<br>\r\n",

      "small table in the centre of the room; bids the negro sit down,<br>\r\n",
      "which he does with some hesitation. The room is small; it contains a<br>\r\n",

      "as if detecting some familiar feature in the stranger's countenance.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No,\" he replies, measuredly; \"but his name has sounded in my ears a<br>\r\n",
      "thousand times. Tell me where are the children, Annette and<br>\r\n",
      "Nicholas? and where may I find Franconia?\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The negro shakes his head, and remains silent for a few minutes. At<br>\r\n",
      "length he raises his hand, and in a half-whisper says, \"Gone, gone,<br>\r\n",
      "gone; sold and scattered, good mas'r. Habn't see dem child dis many<br>\r\n",
      "a day: reckon da'h done gone down south.\" He hesitates suddenly, as<br>\r\n",
      "if calling something to memory; and then, placing his left hand on<br>\r\n",
      "the stranger's right arm, as he rubs his left across his forehead,<br>\r\n",
      "stammers out-\"Mas'r, mas'r, I reckon dis child do know somefin 'bout<br>\r\n",

      "straight on Miss Frankone's where'bout.\" It is what the stranger<br>\r\n",
      "wants. He has heard of Mrs. Rosebrook before; she will give him the<br>\r\n",
      "information he seeks; so, turning again to the negro, he tells him<br>\r\n",
      "that, for a few days at least, he shall require his presence at the<br>\r\n",
      "same hour in the evening: tonight he must conduct him to Mrs.<br>\r\n",

      "is summoning all negroes to their habitations: our guide, Bill,<br>\r\n",
      "informs the stranger that he must have a \"pass\" from a white man<br>\r\n",
      "before he can venture into the street. \"Mas'r may write 'um,\" he<br>\r\n",
      "says, knowing that it matters but little from whom it comes, so long<br>\r\n",
      "as the writer be a white man. The pass is written; the negro<br>\r\n",
      "partakes of refreshment that has been prepared for him at the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger's request, and they are wending their way through the city.<br>\r\n",
      "They pass between rows of massive buildings, many of which have an<br>\r\n",
      "antique appearance, and bear strong signs of neglect; but their<br>\r\n",
      "unique style of architecture denotes the taste of the time in which<br>\r\n",
      "they were erected. Some are distinguished by heavy stone colonnades,<br>\r\n",
      "others by verandas of fret-work, with large gothic windows standing<br>\r\n",
      "in bold outline. Gloomy-looking guard-houses, from which numerous<br>\r\n",
      "armed men are issuing forth for the night's duty,--patrolling figures<br>\r\n",
      "with white cross belts, and armed with batons, standing at corners<br>\r\n",
      "of streets, or moving along with heavy tread on the uneven<br>\r\n",

      "freedom is dangerous in this democratic world; liberty is simply a<br>\r\n",
      "privilege. Again the stranger and his guide (the negro) emerge into<br>\r\n",
      "narrow lanes, and pass along between rows of small dwellings<br>\r\n",
      "inhabited by negroes; but at every turn they encounter mounted<br>\r\n",
      "soldiery, riding two abreast, heavily armed. \"Democracy, boast not<br>\r\n",
      "of thy privileges! tell no man thou governest with equal justice!\"<br>\r\n",
      "said the stranger to himself, as the gas-light shed its flickers<br>\r\n",
      "upon this military array formed to suppress liberty.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "They have reached the outskirts of the city, and are approaching a<br>\r\n",
      "pretty villa, which the negro, who has been explaining the nature<br>\r\n",
      "and duties of this formidable display of citizen soldiery, points<br>\r\n",
      "to, as the peaceful home of the Rosebrook family. Brighter and<br>\r\n",
      "brighter, as they approach, glares the bright light of a window in<br>\r\n",
      "the north front. \"I wish Mas'r Rosebrook owned me,\" says the negro,<br>\r\n",
      "stopping at the garden gate, and viewing the pretty enclosure ere he<br>\r\n",
      "opens it. \"If ebery mas'r and missus war as kind as da'h is, dar<br>\r\n",
      "wouldn't be no need o' dem guard-houses and dem guardmen wid dar<br>\r\n",
      "savage steel,\" he continues, opening the gate gently, and motioning<br>\r\n",
      "the stranger to walk in. Noiselessly he advances up the brick walk<br>\r\n",
      "to the hall entrance, and rings the bell. A well-dressed negro man<br>\r\n",
      "soon makes his appearance, receives him politely, as the guide<br>\r\n",
      "retires, and ushers him into a sumptuously furnished parlour. The<br>\r\n",
      "Rosebrook negroes quickly recognise a gentleman, and detecting it in<br>\r\n",
      "the bearing of the stranger they treat him as such. Mrs. Rosebrook,<br>\r\n",
      "followed by her husband, soon makes her appearance, saluting the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger with her usual suavity. \"I have come, madam,\" he says, \"on<br>\r\n",
      "a strange mission. With you I make no secret of it; should I be<br>\r\n",
      "successful it will remove the grief and anxiety of one who has for<br>\r\n",
      "years mourned the fate of her on whom all her affections seem to<br>\r\n",
      "have centred. If you will but read this it will save the further<br>\r\n",
      "recital of my mission.\" Thus saying, he drew a letter from his<br>\r\n",
      "pocket, presented it, and watched her countenance as line by line<br>\r\n",
      "she read it, and, with tears glistening in her eyes, passed it to<br>\r\n",
      "her husband.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I am, good sir, heartily glad your mission is thus laudable. Be at<br>\r\n",
      "home, and while you are in the city let our home be yours. Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "is here with us to-night; the child you search after is also with<br>\r\n",
      "us, and it was but to-day we learned the cruelties to which she has<br>\r\n",
      "been subjected during the last few years. Indeed, her fate had been<br>\r\n",
      "kept concealed from us until a few weeks ago, and to-day, having<br>\r\n",
      "escaped the brutal designs of a ruffian, she fled to us for<br>\r\n",
      "protection, and is now concealed under our roof-\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, poor wretch-it is too true!\" rejoins Rosebrook. \"But something<br>\r\n",
      "must be done as quickly as possible, for if Pringle Blowers regains<br>\r\n",
      "her she will be subjected to tortures her frame is too delicate to<br>\r\n",
      "bear up under. There must be no time lost, not a day!\" he says, as<br>\r\n",
      "Mrs. Rosebrook quickly leaves the room to convey the news to<br>\r\n",
      "Franconia, who, with Annette, is in an adjoining apartment.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Like a hunted deer, Annette's fears were excited on hearing the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger enter; Franconia is endeavoring to quiet them. The poor<br>\r\n",
      "slave fears the ruffian's pursuit, trembles at each foot-fall upon<br>\r\n",
      "the door-sill, and piteously turns to her old friend for protection.<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers, maddened with disappointment, would rather sacrifice her to<br>\r\n",
      "infamy than sell her for money to a good master. The price of a<br>\r\n",
      "pretty slave is no object with this boasting democrat,--the<br>\r\n",
      "gratification of his carnal desires soars supreme. Rosebrook knows<br>\r\n",
      "this, as the abject woman does to her sorrow.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "As Rosebrook and the stranger sit conversing upon the object of his<br>\r\n",
      "mission, and the best way to effect it, this good woman returns<br>\r\n",
      "leading by the arm a delicately-formed girl, whose blonde<br>\r\n",
      "countenance is shadowed with an air of melancholy which rather adds<br>\r\n",
      "to her charms than detracts from her beauty. The stranger's eye<br>\r\n",
      "rests upon her,--quickly he recognises Clotilda's features,<br>\r\n",
      "Clotilda's form, and gentleness; but she is fairer than Clotilda,<br>\r\n",
      "has blue eyes, and almost golden hair. She hesitates as her eyes<br>\r\n",
      "meet the stranger's. \"Do not fear, my child,\" speaks Franconia,<br>\r\n",
      "whose slender figure follows her into the room. Assured that the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger is her friend, she is introduced to him, and modestly takes<br>\r\n",
      "her seat on a chair by the window. The stranger's name is Maxwell,<br>\r\n",
      "and on hearing it announced Franconia anticipated the pleasure of<br>\r\n",
      "meeting with her old friend, through whose agency she effected<br>\r\n",
      "Clotilda's escape. Advancing towards him with extended hand, she<br>\r\n",
      "looks enquiringly in his face, saying, \"Am I mistaken?\" She shakes<br>\r\n",
      "her head, doubtingly. \"No! it is not my friend Maxwell,\" she<br>\r\n",
      "continues.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No!\" rejoins the stranger; \"he is my cousin: by his directions I<br>\r\n",
      "have come here. I have brought a letter from his wife Clotilda,<br>\r\n",
      "whose dear deliverer you were; and whose thoughts now daily recur to<br>\r\n",
      "you, to your love and kindness to her, with undying brightness.\"<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" interrupts Franconia, welcoming him with a fervent heart, \"I<br>\r\n",

      "joy in her eyes, exclaiming, \"My child! my child! you 'll yet be<br>\r\n",
      "saved. The ruffian who tortured you to-day will torture you no<br>\r\n",
      "more-no more!\" And she kisses the sorrowing girl's cheek, as tears<br>\r\n",
      "of sympathy gush into her eyes.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Rosebrook handed Franconia the letter, which she read as her face<br>\r\n",

      "up; but she wants her slave child! A slave mother never forgets her<br>\r\n",
      "slave offspring!\" she exclaims, with enthusiastic delight, as she<br>\r\n",
      "reads and re-reads the letter. Back she paces to Annette, lays her<br>\r\n",
      "right arm gently over her shoulder, and pats her cheek with her left<br>\r\n",
      "hand: \"Annette will see her mother, yet. There is an all-protecting<br>\r\n",
      "hand guiding us through every ill of life. Be of good cheer, my<br>\r\n",

      "the table she seats her by her side and reads the letter aloud, as<br>\r\n",
      "with joy the forlorn girl's feelings bound forth. We need scarcely<br>\r\n",
      "tell the reader that Clotilda's letter was read in listening<br>\r\n",

      "and boxes on their heads, and then nervously seek the ticket-office,<br>\r\n",
      "where they procure the piece of paper that insures them through to<br>\r\n",
      "New York. Albeit, finding they have quite time enough on their<br>\r\n",

      "another scene of bustle and confusion presents itself. A passenger<br>\r\n",
      "is not quite sure his baggage is all on board, and must needs waste<br>\r\n",
      "his breath in oaths at the dumb porter, who works at his utmost<br>\r\n",
      "strength, under the direction of Mr. Mate, whose important figure is<br>\r\n",
      "poised on the wharf. Another wants to \"lay over\" at Richmond, and is<br>\r\n",
      "using most abusive language to a mulatto waiter, who has put his<br>\r\n",
      "trunk on one side of the boat and carpet bag on the other. A third,<br>\r\n",
      "a fussy old lady with two rosy-faced daughters she is, against her<br>\r\n",

      "upper deck, heeding no one, but now and then affecting to read a<br>\r\n",
      "newspaper, as passengers pace to and fro, is the stranger, seated on<br>\r\n",
      "one of the side seats. The engineer moves his valve now and then,<br>\r\n",
      "the cross-head ascends, the steam hisses below, the condenser<br>\r\n",
      "rumbles, the steam from the funnel roars furiously forth, spreading<br>\r\n",
      "its scalding vapour through the air. Again, the man, almost<br>\r\n",
      "imperceptibly touches the iron rod with his finger, the magic<br>\r\n",
      "monster again moves its piston downward, the wheels make a turn, the<br>\r\n",
      "massive vessel surges upon her lines, as if eager to press forward<br>\r\n",
      "on her course. Another gentle touch, and, obeying the summons, the<br>\r\n",
      "motive power is still; the man subjects the monster with his little<br>\r\n",
      "finger. He has stopped her near the centre, where, with a slight<br>\r\n",
      "touch, he can turn back or forward. Again, he lifts a small key, and<br>\r\n",
      "the steam, with a deafening roar, issues from the escape: he is<br>\r\n",
      "venting his chest. Simultaneously the second bell sounds forth its<br>\r\n",
      "clanking medley: two minutes more, and the snake-like craft will be<br>\r\n",
      "buffeting the waves, on her daily errand. As passengers begin to<br>\r\n",
      "muster on board, their friends clustering round the capsill of the<br>\r\n",
      "wharf, obstructing the way, the sturdy figure of Mr. Pringle Blowers<br>\r\n",

      "scanning the ship from fore to aft. He is not sure she will get off<br>\r\n",
      "by this route; common sense tells him that, but there exists a<br>\r\n",
      "prompting something underneath common sense telling him it's money<br>\r\n",
      "saved to keep a sharp look-out. And this he does merely to gratify<br>\r\n",
      "that inert something, knowing at the same time that, having no<br>\r\n",
      "money, no person will supply her, and she must be concealed in the<br>\r\n",
      "swamps, where only \"niggers\" will relieve her necessities. At this<br>\r\n",
      "moment Rosebrook's carriage may be seen driving to the ticket office<br>\r\n",
      "at the head of the wharf, where Rosebrook, with great coolness, gets<br>\r\n",
      "out, steps within the railing, and procures the tickets in his own<br>\r\n",
      "name. Again taking his seat, the mate, who stands on the capsill of<br>\r\n",
      "the wharf, now and then casting a glance up, cries out, \"Another<br>\r\n",
      "carriage coming!\" Bradshaw cracks his whip, and the horses dash down<br>\r\n",

      "as a dozen black porters, at the mate's command, rush round the<br>\r\n",
      "carriage, seize the baggage, and hurry it on board. Rosebrook,<br>\r\n",
      "fearing his friends will lose their passage, begs people to clear<br>\r\n",
      "the gangway, and almost runs on board, his fugitive charge clinging<br>\r\n",
      "to his arms. The captain stands at the gangway, and recognising the<br>\r\n",
      "late comer, makes one of his blandest bows: he will send a steward<br>\r\n",
      "to show them a good state-room. \"Keep close till the boat leaves,<br>\r\n",
      "and remember there is a world before you,\" Rosebrook says, shaking<br>\r\n",
      "Annette by the hand, as she returns, \"God bless good master!\" They<br>\r\n",
      "are safe in the state-room: he kisses Franconia's cheek, shuts the<br>\r\n",
      "door, and, hurrying back, regains the wharf just as the last bell<br>\r\n",
      "strikes, and the gangway is being carried on board.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not going along with us, eh?\" ejaculates the captain, as, from the<br>\r\n",
      "capsill, Rosebrook looks round to bid him good-by.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not to-day\" (he returns, laconically). \"Take good care of my<br>\r\n",

      "he catches the stranger's eye, and, with a significant motion of his<br>\r\n",
      "fingers, says, \"All safe!\" With a nod of recognition the stranger<br>\r\n",
      "makes his adieu; the fastenings are cast away, the faint tinkle of a<br>\r\n",
      "bell is heard amid the roar of steam; the man at the valves touches<br>\r\n",
      "the throttle bar; up mounts the piston rod-down it surges again; the<br>\r\n",
      "revolving wheels rustle the water; the huge craft moves backward<br>\r\n",
      "easy, and then ahead; a clanking noise denotes the connections are<br>\r\n",
      "\"hooked on,\" and onward she bounds over the sea. How leaps with joy<br>\r\n",
      "that heart yearning for freedom, as the words \"She's away!\" gladden<br>\r\n",
      "Annette's very soul! Her enraptured feelings gush forth in prayer to<br>\r\n",
      "her deliverers; it is as a new spring of life, infusing its<br>\r\n",
      "refreshing waters into desert sands. She seems a new being, with<br>\r\n",

      "recognised as it flashed upon him. He gives Bengal a significant<br>\r\n",
      "wink, the meaning of which he instinctively understands-\"Don't be<br>\r\n",
      "rude,--he belongs to one of the first families!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The stranger lays his left hand on Romescos' arm, and with the fore<br>\r\n",
      "finger of his right hand pointing to the south-west, says, \"My<br>\r\n",
      "plantation is nine miles in that direction. I left it this morning,<br>\r\n",
      "early. In crossing an inlet of the Pedee, I discovered white smoke,<br>\r\n",
      "far ahead, curling upward through the trees, and expanding itself in<br>\r\n",
      "the clear blue atmosphere. Feeling sure it indicated the haunt of<br>\r\n",
      "runaways, I approached it stealthily, and had almost unconsciously<br>\r\n",
      "come upon a negro, who, suddenly springing from his hiding-place,<br>\r\n",
      "ran to the water's edge, plunged in, and swam to a little island a<br>\r\n",
      "few yards in the stream. It did not become me to pursue him, so I<br>\r\n",
      "passed on heedlessly, lest he might have companions, who would set<br>\r\n",
      "upon me, and make me an easy prey to their revengeful feelings.\" As<br>\r\n",
      "each word fell from the stranger's lips, Romescos and his companion<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Again repeating the directions, which the stranger did with great<br>\r\n",
      "precision, they drank a parting social glass: the mounted huntsmen<br>\r\n",
      "thanked the pedestrian for his valuable information, gave him a warm<br>\r\n",
      "shake of the hand, and, as he arranged his haversack, rode off at<br>\r\n",
      "full gallop in the direction indicated. The dogs, cunning brutes,<br>\r\n",
      "trained to the state's brutality, mutely kept in advance. \"In luck<br>\r\n",
      "yet!\" exclaims Bengal, as they rode onward, in high glee,<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Ho! dogs-and back!\" shrieked Romescos, at the top of his shrill<br>\r\n",
      "voice, his sandy hair hanging in tufts over his little reddened<br>\r\n",
      "face, now glowing with excitement. Instantly the dogs started off<br>\r\n",
      "through the thicket, and after making a circle of about a mile,<br>\r\n",
      "returned with heads up, and eyes fiercely flashing. Trailing in a<br>\r\n",
      "semicircle ahead they seemed eager for another command.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Better keep them back,\" mutters Bengal; and as Romescos gives the<br>\r\n",
      "word,--\"Come back!\" they form a trail behind.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Now white fleecy clouds begin to obscure the sun; then it disappears<br>\r\n",

      "course, and to avoid retracing their steps they make a short cut<br>\r\n",
      "through the thicket. In another hour they have reached the bank of<br>\r\n",
      "the stream they sought. Dogs, horses, and men, together drink of its<br>\r\n",
      "limpid waters, and proceed onward. They have yet several miles of<br>\r\n",
      "travel before reaching the spot designated by the strange hunter;<br>\r\n",
      "and seeking their way along the bank is a slow and tedious process.<br>\r\n",
      "The prize-that human outcast, who has no home where democracy<br>\r\n",
      "rules,--is the all-absorbing object of their pursuit; money is the<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "It is near night-fall, when they, somewhat wearied of the day's<br>\r\n",
      "ride, halt on a little slope that extends into the river, and from<br>\r\n",
      "which a long view of its course above opens out. It seems a quiet,<br>\r\n",
      "inviting spot, and so sequestered that Bengal suggests it be made a<br>\r\n",
      "resting-place for the night.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Not a whisper,\" says Romescos, who, having dismounted, is nervously<br>\r\n",
      "watching some object in the distance. It is a pretty spot, clothed<br>\r\n",
      "in softest verdure. How suddenly the quick eye of Romescos<br>\r\n",
      "discovered the white smoke curling above the green foliage! \"See!<br>\r\n",
      "see!\" he whispers again, motioning his hand behind, as Bengal<br>\r\n",
      "stretches his neck, and looks eagerly in the same direction. \"Close<br>\r\n",
      "dogs-close!\" he demands, and the dogs crouch back, and coil their<br>\r\n",
      "sleek bodies at the horses' feet. There, little more than a mile<br>\r\n",
      "ahead, the treacherous smoke curls lazily upward, spreading a white<br>\r\n",
      "haze in the blue atmosphere. Daddy Bob has a rude camp there. A few<br>\r\n",
      "branches serve for a covering, the bare moss is his bed; the fires<br>\r\n",
      "of his heart would warm it, were nothing more at hand! Near by is<br>\r\n",
      "the island on which he seeks refuge when the enemy approaches; and<br>\r\n",
      "from this lone spot-his home for more than two years-has he sent<br>\r\n",
      "forth many a fervent prayer, beseeching Almighty God to be his<br>\r\n",
      "shield and his deliverer. It was but yesterday he saw Jerushe, who<br>\r\n",
      "shared with him her corn-cakes, which, when she does not meet him at<br>\r\n",
      "his accustomed spot, she places at the foot of a marked tree. Bob<br>\r\n",
      "had added a few chips to his night fire, (his defence against<br>\r\n",
      "tormenting mosquitoes), and made his moss bed. Having tamed an owl<br>\r\n",
      "and a squirrel, they now make his rude camp their home, and share<br>\r\n",
      "his crumbs. The squirrel nestles above his head, as the owl, moping<br>\r\n",
      "about the camp entrance, suddenly hoots a warning and flutters its<br>\r\n",
      "way into the thicket. Starting to his feet with surprise-the<br>\r\n",
      "squirrel chirping at the sudden commotion-the tramp of horses breaks<br>\r\n",
      "fearfully upon the old man's ear; bewildered he bounds from the<br>\r\n",
      "camp. Two water oaks stand a few feet from its entrance, and through<br>\r\n",
      "them he descries his pursuers bearing down upon him at full speed,<br>\r\n",
      "the dogs making the very forest echo with their savage yelps. They<br>\r\n",
      "are close upon him; the island is his only refuge! Suddenly he leaps<br>\r\n",
      "to the bank, plunges into the stream, and with death-like struggles<br>\r\n",
      "gains the opposite shore, where he climbs a cedar, as the dogs,<br>\r\n",
      "eager with savage pursuit, follow in his wake, and are well nigh<br>\r\n",
      "seizing his extremities ere they cleared their vicious spring. The<br>\r\n",
      "two horsemen vault to the spot from whence the old man plunged into<br>\r\n",
      "the water; and while the dogs make hideous ravings beneath the tree,<br>\r\n",
      "they sit upon their horses, consulting, as the old man, from the<br>\r\n",
      "tree top, looks piteously over the scene. Life has few charms for<br>\r\n",
      "him; death would not be unwelcome.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The tedious journey, and disappointment at seeing the old man's<br>\r\n",
      "resolution, has excited Romescos' ire. \"He's an old rack-not worth<br>\r\n",
      "much, but he doesn't seem like Kemp's old saw-horse,\" Romescos<br>\r\n",
      "remarks to Bengal, as his hawk eye scans the old man perched among<br>\r\n",
      "the cedar branches. They are not more than forty yards apart, and<br>\r\n",
      "within speaking distance. Bengal, less excited, thinks it better to<br>\r\n",
      "secure the old \"coon\" without letting the dogs taste of him.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"They'll only hold him with a firm grip, when he dismounts, and swim<br>\r\n",
      "him safe back,\" grumblingly returns Romescos. \"Now! old<br>\r\n",
      "nig\"-Romescos shouts at the top of his voice, directing himself to<br>\r\n",
      "the old man-\"just trot back here-come along!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The old man shakes his head, and raises his hands, as if pleading<br>\r\n",
      "for mercy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"You won't, eh?\" returns the angry man, raising his rifle in an<br>\r\n",
      "attitude of preparation. Bengal reminds Romescos that his horse is<br>\r\n",
      "not accustomed to firing from the saddle.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I will larn him, then,\" is the reply.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",

      "where 'um is.\"<br>\r\n",

      "rifle.) \"Ye'll come down out of that-by heavens you will!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Wing him; don't shoot the fool!\" suggests Bengal, as the old man,<br>\r\n",
      "pleading with his pursuers, winds his body half round the tree.<br>\r\n",
      "Tick! tick! went the cock of Romescos' rifle; he levelled it to his<br>\r\n",
      "eye,--a sharp whistling report rung through the air, and the body of<br>\r\n",
      "the old man, shot through the heart, lumbered to the earth, as a<br>\r\n",
      "deadly shriek sounds high above the echoes over the distant<br>\r\n",
      "landscape-\"M'as'r in heaven take 'um and have mercy on 'um!\" gurgles<br>\r\n",
      "on the air: his body writhes convulsively-the devouring dogs spring<br>\r\n",
      "savagely upon the ration-all is over with the old slave!<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Instantly with the report of the rifle, Romescos' horse darts,<br>\r\n",
      "vaults toward the oaks, halts suddenly, and, ere he has time to<br>\r\n",
      "grasp the reins, throws him headlong against one of their trunks. An<br>\r\n",
      "oath escapes his lips as from the saddle he lifted; not a word more<br>\r\n",
      "did he lisp, but sank on the ground a corpse. His boon companion,<br>\r\n",
      "forgetting the dogs in their banquet of flesh, quickly dismounts,<br>\r\n",
      "seizes the body in his arms, the head hanging carelessly from the<br>\r\n",
      "shoulders: a few quivering shrugs, and all is over. \"Neck broken,<br>\r\n",
      "and dead!\" ejaculates the affrighted companion, resting the dead<br>\r\n",
      "hunter's back against his left knee, and with his right hand across<br>\r\n",

      "ever had,\" mutters Bengal, glancing revengefully toward the island,<br>\r\n",
      "where his democratic dogs are busy in the work of destruction. Then<br>\r\n",
      "he stretches the lifeless body on the ground, crosses those hands<br>\r\n",
      "full of blood and treachery, draws a handkerchief from his pocket,<br>\r\n",
      "spreads it over the ghastly face fast discolouring, as the riderless<br>\r\n",
      "horse, as if by instinct, bounds back to the spot and suddenly halts<br>\r\n",
      "over his dead master, where he frets the ground with his hoof, and,<br>\r\n",
      "with nostrils extended, scents along the body. Having done this, as<br>\r\n",
      "if in sorrow, he will rest on the ground beside him; slowly he<br>\r\n",

      "lifeless ruffian on the ground.<br>\r\n",

      "\"Not all loss, yet!\" he adds, a glow of satisfaction infusing his<br>\r\n",

      "perhaps obtain, the state's reward for the despatch of outlaws; and<br>\r\n",
      "with the gory trophy he returns across the limpid stream to his<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I'll go to a whipping-post no more!\" exclaims Nicholas, his angry<br>\r\n",
      "spirit flashing in his face, as in an attitude of defence he presses<br>\r\n",
      "his right hand into his bosom, and frowns defiantly upon the<br>\r\n",
      "intruders.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"My name is Monsel, an officer! Not a word of disobedience,\" returns<br>\r\n",
      "the officer, in a peremptory voice.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Another suggests that he had better be throated at once. But the<br>\r\n",
      "chained victim of democracy's rule warns them against advancing<br>\r\n",
      "another step. \"Either must die if you advance. I have counselled<br>\r\n",
      "death, and will lay my prostrate body on the cold floor rather than<br>\r\n",
      "be taken from this cell to the whipping-post. It is far better to<br>\r\n",
      "die defending my right, than to yield my life under the lash! I<br>\r\n",
      "appeal to you, officers of the state, protectors of the peace, men<br>\r\n",
      "who love their right as life's boons!\" The men hesitate, whisper<br>\r\n",
      "among themselves, seem at a loss as to what course to pursue. \"You<br>\r\n",
      "are setting the laws of the state at defiance, my good fellow!\"<br>\r\n",
      "rejoins Monsel.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"I care not for the law of the state! Its laws for me are founded in<br>\r\n",
      "wrong, exercised with injustice!\" Turning towards the door, Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Monsel despatches his fellow-officers for a reinforcement. That<br>\r\n",
      "there will be a desperate struggle he has no doubt. The man's<br>\r\n",
      "gestures show him fully armed; and he is stark mad. During the<br>\r\n",
      "interim, Mr. Monsel will hold a parley with the boy. He finds,<br>\r\n",
      "however, that a few smooth words will not subdue him. One of the<br>\r\n",
      "officials has a rope in his hand, with which he would make a lasso,<br>\r\n",
      "and, throwing it over his head, secure him an easy captive. Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Monsel will not hear of such a cowardly process. He is a wiry man,<br>\r\n",
      "with stunted features, and has become enured to the perils of negro<br>\r\n",
      "catching. Hand to hand he has had many an encounter with the brutes,<br>\r\n",
      "and always came off victor; never did he fail to serve the interests<br>\r\n",
      "of the state, nor to protect the property of his client. With a sort<br>\r\n",
      "of bravado he makes another advance. The city esteems him for the<br>\r\n",
      "valuable services he has rendered its safety; why should he shrink<br>\r\n",
      "in this emergency?<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Our southern readers, in a certain state, will readily recognise the<br>\r\n",
      "scene we here describe. The chained man, drawing his shining steel<br>\r\n",
      "from his bosom, says, \"You take me not from here, alive.\" Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Monsel's face becomes pale, while Nicholas's flashes angry scowls;<br>\r\n",
      "an irresistible nervousness seizes him,--for a moment he hesitates,<br>\r\n",
      "turns half round to see if his companions stand firm. They are close<br>\r\n",
      "behind, ready for the spring, like sharp-eyed catamounts; while<br>\r\n",
      "around the door anxious visitors crowd their curious faces. The<br>\r\n",
      "officers second in command file off to the right and left, draw<br>\r\n",
      "their revolvers, and present them in the attitude of firing. \"Use<br>\r\n",
      "that knife, and you fall!\" exclaims one, with a fearful imprecation.<br>\r\n",
      "At the next moment he fires, as Monsel rushes upon the chained man,<br>\r\n",
      "followed by half a dozen officials. An agonising shriek is heard,<br>\r\n",
      "and Monsel, in guttural accents, mutters, \"I am a murdered man-he<br>\r\n",
      "has murdered me! Oh, my God,--he has murdered me!\" Nicholas has<br>\r\n",
      "plunged the knife into the fleshy part of Monsel's right arm; and<br>\r\n",
      "while the bloody weapon, wrested from his hand, lies on the floor,<br>\r\n",
      "an official drags the wounded man from his grasp. As some rise,<br>\r\n",
      "others fall upon him like infuriated animals, and but for the timely<br>\r\n",
      "presence of Grabguy and Graspum would have despatched him like a<br>\r\n",
      "bullock chained to a stake. The presence of these important<br>\r\n",
      "personages produces a cessation of hostilities; but the victim,<br>\r\n",
      "disarmed, lies prostrate on the ground, a writhing and distorted<br>\r\n",
      "body, tortured beyond his strength of endurance. A circle where the<br>\r\n",
      "struggle ensued is wet with blood, in which Nicholas bathes his poor<br>\r\n",
      "writhing body until it becomes one crimson mass.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "All attention is now directed to the wounded man, who, it is found,<br>\r\n",
      "although he has bled freely of good red blood, is neither fatally<br>\r\n",
      "nor seriously wounded. It is merely a flesh wound in the arm, such<br>\r\n",
      "as young gentlemen of the south frequently inflict upon each other<br>\r\n",
      "for the purpose of sustaining their character for bravery. But the<br>\r\n",
      "oppressed slave has raised his hand against a white man,--he must pay<br>\r\n",
      "the penalty with his life; he no longer can live to keep peaceful<br>\r\n",
      "citizens in fear and trembling. Prostrate on the floor, the victors<br>\r\n",
      "gather round him again, as Graspum stoops down and unlocks the<br>\r\n",
      "shackle from his leg. \"It's the Ingin, you see: the very devil<br>\r\n",
      "wouldn't subdue it, and when once its revenge breaks out you might<br>\r\n",
      "just as well try to govern a sweeping tornado,\" Graspum remarks,<br>\r\n",
      "coolly, as he calls a negro attendant, and orders the body to be<br>\r\n",
      "drawn from out the puddle of disfiguring gore. Languidly that poor<br>\r\n",
      "bosom heaves, his eyes half close, and his motionless lips pale as<br>\r\n",
      "death.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Had I know'd it when I bargained for him, he would never have<br>\r\n",

      "a quick insight of things,--Ingin's Ingin, though!\" says Grabguy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"The very look might have told you that, my dear fellow; I sold him<br>\r\n",

      "Mr. Grabguy politely says, he meant no insinuations. \"Come,<br>\r\n",
      "Nicholas! I told you this would be the end on't,\" he continues,<br>\r\n",
      "stooping down and taking him by the shoulders, with an air of<br>\r\n",
      "commiseration.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The bruised body, as if suddenly inspired with new life, raises<br>\r\n",
      "itself half up, and with eyes opening, gazes vacantly at those<br>\r\n",
      "around, at its own hands besmeared with gore; then, with a curl of<br>\r\n",
      "contempt on his lip, at the shackle just released from his limb-\"Ah,<br>\r\n",
      "well, it's ended here; this is the last of me, no doubt,\" he<br>\r\n",
      "murmurs, and makes another attempt to rise.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Don't move from where you are!\" commands an official, setting his<br>\r\n",
      "hand firmly against his right shoulder, and pressing him back. He<br>\r\n",
      "has got the infective crimson on his hands, chafes them one against<br>\r\n",
      "the other, perpendicularly, as Nicholas looks at him doubtingly.<br>\r\n",
      "\"It's all over--I'll not harm you; take me to a slaughter-house if<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",

      "before Nicholas has time to answer, turns to the official, saying,<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know'd he would!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The official bows his head significantly, but begs to inform Mr.<br>\r\n",

      "state, is no longer under his care. He is a prisoner, and must, as<br>\r\n",
      "the law directs, answer for the heinous crime just committed. Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Grabguy, if he please, may forward his demand to the state<br>\r\n",

      "receive its award-two hundred round dollars, or thereabouts.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",

      "Rumour, ever ready to spread its fears in a slave state, reported an<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The officer, in answer to a question why he does not take the man<br>\r\n",
      "away, says he has sent for means to secure him. He had scarcely<br>\r\n",
      "given out the acceptable information, when an official, followed by<br>\r\n",
      "a negro man, bearing cords over his right arm, makes his appearance.<br>\r\n",
      "The oppressed man seems subdued, and as they make the first knot<br>\r\n",

      "\"'Twouldn't be much to hang a slave! Now round my hands. Now, with a<br>\r\n",
      "half hitch, take my legs!\" thus mocking, as it were, while they<br>\r\n",
      "twist the cords about his yielding limbs. Now they draw his head to<br>\r\n",
      "his knees, and his hands to his feet, forming a curve of his<br>\r\n",
      "disabled body. \"How I bend to your strong ropes, your strong laws,<br>\r\n",

      "bruised and lacerated body, confined in an unhealthy cell, has<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The day upon which the trial is to take place has arrived. On the<br>\r\n",
      "south side of Broad Street there stands a small wooden building, the<br>\r\n",
      "boarding discoloured and decayed, looking as if it had been<br>\r\n",

      "and ruddy face, nicely trimmed whiskers, soft blue eyes, tolerably<br>\r\n",
      "good teeth, he is considered rather a handsome man. But (to use a<br>\r\n",
      "vulgar phrase) he is death on night orgies and nigger trials. He may<br>\r\n",
      "be seen any day of the week, about twelve o'clock, standing his long<br>\r\n",
      "figure in the door of his legal domicile, his hat touching the sill,<br>\r\n",
      "looking up and then down the street, as if waiting the arrival of a<br>\r\n",
      "victim upon whom to pronounce one of his awful judgments. Felsh is a<br>\r\n",
      "different species of person, being a short, stunted man, with a<br>\r\n",
      "flat, inexpressive face. He has very much the appearance of a man<br>\r\n",
      "who had been clumsily thrown together for any purpose future<br>\r\n",
      "circumstances might require. Between these worthies and one Hanz Von<br>\r\n",
      "Vickeinsteighner there has long existed a business connection, which<br>\r\n",
      "is now being transferred into a fraternity of good fellowship. Hanz<br>\r\n",

      "lager-beer, and whiskey; the last-named article is sure to be very<br>\r\n",
      "bad, inasmuch as his customers are principally negroes. Von is<br>\r\n",
      "considered a very clever fellow, never a very bad citizen, and<br>\r\n",
      "always on terms of politeness with a great many squires, and other<br>\r\n",
      "members of the legal profession. A perfect picture of the<br>\r\n",
      "good-natured Dutchman is Von, as seen standing his square sides in<br>\r\n",
      "his doorway, stripped to his sleeves, his red cap tipped aside, a<br>\r\n",
      "crooked grin on his broad fat face, and his hands thrust beneath a<br>\r\n",
      "white apron into his nether pockets. Von has a great relish for<br>\r\n",
      "squires and police officers, esteems them the salt of all good, nor<br>\r\n",
      "ever charges them a cent for his best-brewed lager-beer. There is,<br>\r\n",
      "however, a small matter of business in the way, which Von, being<br>\r\n",
      "rather a sharp logician, thinks it quite as well to reconcile with<br>\r\n",

      "negro case being about to be brought forward, Fetter and Von may be<br>\r\n",
      "seen, as before described, standing importantly easy in their<br>\r\n",
      "respective doors; while Felsh paces up and down the side-walk,<br>\r\n",
      "seemingly in deep study. On these occasions it is generally said Von<br>\r\n",
      "makes the criminal \"niggers,\" Felsh orders them caught and brought<br>\r\n",
      "before Fletter, and Fetter passes awful judgment upon them. Now and<br>\r\n",
      "then, Felsh will prosecute on behalf of the state, for which that<br>\r\n",
      "generous embodiment of bad law is debtor the fees.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The city clock has struck twelve; Fetter stands in his doorway, his<br>\r\n",
      "countenance wearing an air of great seriousness. Felsh saunters at<br>\r\n",
      "the outside, now and then making some legal remark on a point of the<br>\r\n",
      "negro statutes, and at every turn casting his bleared eye up the<br>\r\n",
      "street. Presently, Nicholas is seen, his hands pinioned, and a heavy<br>\r\n",
      "chain about his neck, approaching between two officials. A crowd<br>\r\n",
      "follows; among it are several patriotic persons who evince an<br>\r\n",
      "inclination to wrest him from the officials, that they may,<br>\r\n",
      "according to Judge Lynch's much-used privileges, wreak their<br>\r\n",
      "vengeance in a summary manner. \"The boy Nicholas is to be tried to-<br>\r\n",

      "assemble round the squire's office, and Hanz Von Vickeinsteighner is<br>\r\n",
      "in great good humour at the prospect of a profitable day at his<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Bring the criminal in!\" says Squire Fetter, turning into his office<br>\r\n",

      "of board seats stretch across the little nook, which is about<br>\r\n",
      "sixteen feet wide by twenty long, the floor seeming on the verge of<br>\r\n",
      "giving way under its professional burden. The plaster hangs in<br>\r\n",
      "broken flakes from the walls, which are exceedingly dingy, and<br>\r\n",
      "decorated with festoons of melancholy cobwebs. At the farther end is<br>\r\n",
      "an antique book-case of pine slats, on which are promiscuously<br>\r\n",

      "crime for which he stands arraigned before you, has excited no small<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "His honour, leaning forward, places the fore-finger of his right<br>\r\n",

      "while in prison, confined in a cell under his supervision, admitted<br>\r\n",
      "that he intended to kill Mr. Monsel when he inflicted the wound. He<br>\r\n",

      "been put in to warrant a conviction. It's a pity to hang such<br>\r\n",

      "suggests that Mr. Grabguy had better not interrupt the court with<br>\r\n",
      "questions. That he has an indirect interest in the issue of the<br>\r\n",
      "suit, not a doubt exists, but if he be not satisfied with the<br>\r\n",
      "witness's statement, he has his remedy in the court of appeals,<br>\r\n",
      "where, upon the ground of testimony having been elicited by coercion<br>\r\n",
      "or cruelty, a new trial will probably be granted.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Mr. Grabguy would merely suggest to his honour that although<br>\r\n",
      "sentencing a negro to be hung may be a matter of small consequence<br>\r\n",
      "to him, yet his position in society gives him a right to be heard<br>\r\n",
      "with proper respect. Aware that he does not move in that exclusively<br>\r\n",
      "aristocratic sphere of society awarded to lawyers in general, he is<br>\r\n",

      "like a full moon peeping through a rain cloud, attempts to pacify<br>\r\n",
      "his colleague, Fetter. The court is foaming with excitement; Mr.<br>\r\n",
      "Felsh is excited, the jury are excited to take a little more drink,<br>\r\n",
      "the constables are excited, the audience are excited to amusement;<br>\r\n",
      "Messrs. Fetter and Felsh's court rocks with excitement: the only<br>\r\n",

      "democracy-that democracy giving him no common right under the laws<br>\r\n",
      "of the land, unless, indeed, he could change his skin. Ardently as<br>\r\n",
      "he was attached to the plantation and its people-much as he loved<br>\r\n",
      "good master and missus, he would prefer a home in happy New England,<br>\r\n",

      "Rosebrooks provided him with money, sent him to the land he had<br>\r\n",
      "longed to live in. In Connecticut he has a neat and comfortable<br>\r\n",
      "home, far from the cares of slave life; no bloodhounds seek him<br>\r\n",
      "there, no cruel slave-dealer haunts his dreams. An intelligent<br>\r\n",

      "Wilmington, swiftly gliding on her course. Four bells struck as the<br>\r\n",

      "slender invalid, so neat of figure, and whose dress exhibited so<br>\r\n",
      "much good taste, has been suddenly transformed into a delicate girl<br>\r\n",

      "together with a drawn bonnet of green silk, simply arranged, and<br>\r\n",
      "adding to her fair oval face an air of peculiar delicacy, present<br>\r\n",

      "soft blue eyes, and her almost golden hair, hanging in thick wavy<br>\r\n",
      "folds over her carnatic cheeks, add to the symmetry of her features<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "The suddenness with which they embarked served to confuse and dispel<br>\r\n",

      "toward him, hesitated ere he greeted Annette and extended his hand.<br>\r\n",
      "But they soon joined in conversation, promenaded and mingled with<br>\r\n",
      "the passengers. Cautious not to enter the main cabin, they remained,<br>\r\n",
      "supperless, on the upper deck, until near midnight. That social<br>\r\n",
      "prejudice which acts like a crushing weight upon the slave's mind<br>\r\n",

      "rhapsody of praise and thankfulness. Holding Franconia by the hand,<br>\r\n",

      "recount the pleasure she anticipated when meeting her long-lost<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"No, my poor child; you won't be worth selling in a land of<br>\r\n",

      "a double duty was to be performed in his guardianship over the being<br>\r\n",

      "discovery of gold in California, having joined a marauding party who<br>\r\n",
      "were traversing that country, was amongst the earliest who enriched<br>\r\n",

      "pursuits, and with energy and prudence stored-up their diggings, and<br>\r\n",
      "resolved to lead a new life. With the result of one year's digging,<br>\r\n",
      "Lorenzo repaired to San Francisco, entered upon a lucrative<br>\r\n",
      "business, increased his fortune, and soon became a leading man of<br>\r\n",

      "to return home, wipe away the stain which blotted his character, and<br>\r\n",
      "relieve his parents from the troubles into which his follies had<br>\r\n",
      "brought them, seemed like a guiding star ever before him. And then<br>\r\n",
      "there was his generous-hearted uncle in the hands of Graspum,--that<br>\r\n",
      "man who never lost an opportunity of enriching himself while<br>\r\n",

      "Rosebrook's bosom, saying, \"Oh, how happy I am! Sweet is the<br>\r\n",
      "forgiveness which awaits us,--strong is the hope that through<br>\r\n",
      "darkness carries us into brighter prospects of the future.\" Her<br>\r\n",

      "honourable man, and regretting that error which cost him many a<br>\r\n",
      "tear, was with them. How inscrutable was the will of an all-wise<br>\r\n",
      "Providence: but how just! To be ever sanguine, and hope for the<br>\r\n",
      "best, is a passion none should be ashamed of, she thought. Thus<br>\r\n",

      "among cast-out gamblers, mingled only with their despicable society.<br>\r\n",
      "Stripped of all arts and disguises, and presented in its best form,<br>\r\n",

      "its associations so dear to her childhood; and with God and happy<br>\r\n",

      "For three days the gallant ship sped swiftly onward, and the<br>\r\n",
      "passengers, among whom she made many friends, seemed to enjoy<br>\r\n",
      "themselves with one accord, mingling together for various<br>\r\n",
      "amusements, spreading their social influence for the good of all,<br>\r\n",
      "and, with elated spirits at the bright prospect, anticipating a<br>\r\n",
      "speedy voyage. All was bright, calm, and cheering-the monster<br>\r\n",
      "machines working smoothly, pressing the leviathan forward with<br>\r\n",
      "curling brine at her bows, until the afternoon of the fourth day,<br>\r\n",
      "when the wind in sharp gusts from the south-west, and the sudden<br>\r\n",
      "falling of the barometer, admonished the mariner of the approaching<br>\r\n",
      "heavy weather. At sunset a heavy bank in the west hung its<br>\r\n",
      "foreboding festoons along the horizon, while light, fleecy clouds<br>\r\n",
      "gathered over the heavens, and scudded swiftly into the east.<br>\r\n",
      "Steadily the wind increased, the sea became restless, and the sharp<br>\r\n",
      "chops thundering at the weather bow, veering the ship from her<br>\r\n",
      "course, rendering it necessary to keep her head a point nearer the<br>\r\n",
      "westward, betokened a gale. To leeward were the Bahamas, their<br>\r\n",
      "dangerous banks spreading awe among the passengers, and exciting the<br>\r\n",
      "fears of the more timid. On the starboard bow was Key West, with its<br>\r\n",
      "threatening and deceptive reefs, but far enough ahead to be out of<br>\r\n",
      "danger. At midnight, the wind, which had increased to a gale, howled<br>\r\n",
      "in threatening fierceness. Overhead, the leaden clouds hung low<br>\r\n",
      "their massive folds, and thick spray buried the decks and rigging;<br>\r\n",
      "beneath, the angry ocean spread out in resistless waves of<br>\r\n",
      "phosphorous light, and the gallant craft surged to and fro like a<br>\r\n",
      "thing of life on a plain of rolling fire. Now she yields to the<br>\r\n",
      "monster wave threatening her bow, over another she rides proudly,<br>\r\n",
      "and to a third her engines slowly rumble round, as with half-buried<br>\r\n",
      "deck she careens to its force. The man at the wheel, whose head we<br>\r\n",
      "see near a glimmering light at the stern, watches anxiously for the<br>\r\n",
      "word of command, and when received, executes it with quickness. An<br>\r\n",
      "intruding sea has driven the look-out from the knight-heads to a<br>\r\n",
      "post at the funnel, where, near the foremast, he clings with<br>\r\n",
      "tenacious grip. Near him is the first officer, a veteran seaman, who<br>\r\n",
      "has seen some twenty years' service, receiving orders from the<br>\r\n",
      "captain, who stands at the weather quarter. Noiselessly the men<br>\r\n",
      "proceed to execute their duties. There is not that bustle nor<br>\r\n",
      "display of seamanship, in preparing a steamer for encountering a<br>\r\n",
      "gale, so necessary in a sailing-ship; and all, save the angry<br>\r\n",
      "elements, move cautiously on. The engineer, in obedience to the<br>\r\n",
      "captain's orders, has slowed his engines. The ship can make but<br>\r\n",
      "little headway against the fierce sea; but still, obedient to her<br>\r\n",
      "command, it is thought better to maintain power just sufficient to<br>\r\n",
      "keep her head to the sea. The captain says it is necessary, as well<br>\r\n",
      "to ease her working as not to strain her machinery. He is supposed<br>\r\n",
      "the better judge, and to his counsel all give ear. Now and then a<br>\r\n",
      "more resolute passenger shoots from no one knows where, holds<br>\r\n",
      "struggling by the jerking shroud, and, wrapt in his storm cloak, his<br>\r\n",
      "amazed eyes, watching the scudding elements overhead, peer out upon<br>\r\n",
      "the raging sea: then he mutters, \"What an awful sight! how madly<br>\r\n",
      "grand with briny light!\" How sublimely terrific are the elements<br>\r\n",
      "here combined to wage war against the craft he thought safe from<br>\r\n",
      "their thunders! She is but a pigmy in their devouring sweep, a<br>\r\n",
      "feeble prey at their mercy. The starboard wheel rumbles as it turns<br>\r\n",
      "far out of water; the larboard is buried in a deep sea the ship<br>\r\n",
      "careens into. Through the fierce drear he sees the black funnel<br>\r\n",
      "vomiting its fiery vapour high aloft; he hears the chain braces<br>\r\n",
      "strain and creak in its support; he is jerked from his grasp,<br>\r\n",
      "becomes alarmed for his safety, and suddenly disappears. In the<br>\r\n",
      "cabin he tells his fellow voyagers how the storm rages fearfully:<br>\r\n",
      "but it needed not his word to confirm the fact: the sudden lurching,<br>\r\n",
      "creaking of panel-work, swinging to and fro of lamps, sliding from<br>\r\n",
      "larboard to starboard of furniture, the thumping of the sea against<br>\r\n",
      "the ship's sides, prostrate passengers made helpless by sea<br>\r\n",
      "sickness, uncouched and distributed about the floor, moaning<br>\r\n",
      "females, making those not ill sick with their wailings, timid<br>\r\n",
      "passengers in piteous accents making their lamentations in state<br>\r\n",
      "rooms, the half frightened waiter struggling timidly along, and the<br>\r\n",
      "wind's mournful music as it plays through the shrouds, tell the tale<br>\r\n",
      "but too forcibly. Hope, fear, and prayer, mingle in curious discord<br>\r\n",
      "on board this seemingly forlorn ship on an angry sea. Franconia lies<br>\r\n",
      "prostrate in her narrow berth, now bracing against the panels, then<br>\r\n",
      "startled by an angry sea striking at her pillow, like death with his<br>\r\n",
      "warning mallet announcing, \"but sixteen inches separate us!\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Daylight dawns forth, much to the relief of mariners and passengers;<br>\r\n",
      "but neither the wind nor the sea have lessened their fierceness.<br>\r\n",
      "Slowly and steadily the engines work on; the good ship looks<br>\r\n",
      "defiantly at each threatening sea, as it sweeps along irresistibly;<br>\r\n",
      "the yards have been sent down, the topmasts are struck and housed;<br>\r\n",
      "everything that can render her easy in a sea has been stowed to the<br>\r\n",
      "snuggest compass; but the broad ocean is spread out a sheet of<br>\r\n",
      "raging foam. The drenched captain, his whiskers matted with saline,<br>\r\n",
      "and his face glowing and flushed (he has stood the deck all night),<br>\r\n",
      "may be seen in the main cabin, cheering and dispelling the fears of<br>\r\n",
      "his passengers. The storm cannot last-the wind will soon lull-the<br>\r\n",
      "sea at meridian will be as calm as any mill-pond-he has seen a<br>\r\n",
      "thousand worse gales; so says the mariner, who will pledge his<br>\r\n",
      "prophecy on his twenty years' experience. But in this one instance<br>\r\n",
      "his prophecy failed, for at noon the gale had increased to a<br>\r\n",
      "hurricane, the ship laboured fearfully, the engines strained and<br>\r\n",
      "worked unsteadily, while the sea at intervals made a breach of the<br>\r\n",
      "deck. At two o'clock a more gloomy spectacle presented itself; and<br>\r\n",
      "despondency seemed to have seized all on board, as a sharp,<br>\r\n",
      "cone-like sea boarded the ship abaft, carried away the quarter-boats<br>\r\n",
      "from the starboard davys, and started several stancheons. Scarcely<br>\r\n",
      "was the work of destruction complete, when the condenser of the<br>\r\n",
      "larboard engine gave out, rendering the machine useless, and<br>\r\n",
      "spreading dismay among the passengers. Thus, dragging the wheel in<br>\r\n",
      "so fearful a sea strained the ship more and more, and rendered her<br>\r\n",
      "almost unmanageable. Again a heavy, clanking noise was heard, the<br>\r\n",
      "steam rumbled from the funnel, thick vapour escaped from the<br>\r\n",
      "hatchways, the starboard engine stopped, and consternation reigned<br>\r\n",
      "triumphant, as a man in oily fustian approached the captain and<br>\r\n",
      "announced both engines disabled. The unmanageable monster now rolled<br>\r\n",
      "and surged at the sweep of each succeeding sea, which threatened to<br>\r\n",
      "engulph her in its sway. A piece of canvas is set in the main<br>\r\n",
      "rigging, and her helm put hard down, in the hope of keeping her head<br>\r\n",
      "to the wind. But she obeys not its direction. Suddenly she yaws off<br>\r\n",
      "into the trough of the sea, lurches broad on, and ere she regains<br>\r\n",
      "her way, a fierce sea sweeps the house from the decks, carrying<br>\r\n",
      "those within it into a watery grave. Shrieks and moans, for a<br>\r\n",
      "moment, mingle their painful discord with the murmuring wind, and<br>\r\n",
      "all is buried in the roar of the elements. By bracing the fore-yard<br>\r\n",
      "hard-a-starboard the unwieldy wreck is got before the wind; but the<br>\r\n",
      "smoke-funnel has followed the house, and so complete is the work of<br>\r\n",
      "demolition that it is with difficulty she can be kept afloat. Those<br>\r\n",
      "who were in the main, or lower cabin, startled at the sudden crash<br>\r\n",
      "which had removed the house above, and leaving the passages open,<br>\r\n",
      "exposing them to the rushing water that invaded their state-rooms,<br>\r\n",
      "seek the deck, where a more dismal sight is presented in the<br>\r\n",
      "fragments of wreck spread from knight-head to taffrail. The anxious<br>\r\n",
      "captain, having descended from the upper deck a few minutes before<br>\r\n",
      "the dire calamity, is saved to his passengers, with whom and his men<br>\r\n",
      "he labours to make safe what remains of his noble ship. Now more at<br>\r\n",
      "ease in the sea, with canvas brought from the store-rooms, are the<br>\r\n",
      "hatches and companions battened down, the splintered stancheons<br>\r\n",
      "cleared away, and extra pumps prepared for clearing the water fast<br>\r\n",
      "gaining in the lower hold. Lumbering moves the heavy mass over the<br>\r\n",
      "mounting surge; but a serious leak having sprung in the bow,<br>\r\n",
      "consternation and alarm seem on the point of adding to the sources<br>\r\n",
      "of danger. \"Coolness is our safeguard,\" says the captain. Indeed,<br>\r\n",
      "the exercise of that all-important virtue when destruction threatens<br>\r\n",
      "would have saved thousands from watery graves.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "His admonition was heeded,--all worked cheerfully, and for some time<br>\r\n",
      "the water was kept within bounds of subjection. As night approached<br>\r\n",
      "the sea became calmer, a bright streak gleamed along the western<br>\r\n",
      "horizon; hearts that had sorrowed gladdened with joy, as the murky<br>\r\n",
      "clouds overhead chased quickly into the east and dissolved, and the<br>\r\n",
      "blue arch of heaven-hung with pearly stars of hope-shed its peaceful<br>\r\n",
      "glows over the murmuring sea.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Again the night was passed in incessant labour of pumping and<br>\r\n",
      "clearing up the dismantled hull; but when daylight appeared, the<br>\r\n",
      "wind having veered and increased, the sea ran in short swells,<br>\r\n",
      "rocking the unwieldly hull, and fearfully straining every timber in<br>\r\n",
      "its frame. The leak now increased rapidly, as also did the water in<br>\r\n",
      "the hold, now beyond their exertions to clear. At ten o'clock all<br>\r\n",
      "hopes of keeping the wreck afloat had disappeared; and the last<br>\r\n",
      "alternative of a watery grave, or launching upon the broad ocean,<br>\r\n",
      "presented its stern terms for their acceptance. A council decided to<br>\r\n",
      "adopt the latter, when, as the hulk began to settle in the sea, and<br>\r\n",
      "with no little danger of swamping, boats were launched, supplied<br>\r\n",
      "with such stores as were at hand, the passengers and crew embarked,<br>\r\n",
      "and the frail barks sent away with their hapless freight to seek a<br>\r\n",

      "that seeming the nearest and most available point. The clothing they<br>\r\n",

      "fair, kept the little bark steadily on her course, hoping thereby to<br>\r\n",
      "gain it before night came on: but the sun sank in a heavy cloud when<br>\r\n",

      "the morning-that had cheered many a drooping heart, and seemed a<br>\r\n",
      "haven of safety, threatened their destruction. The water shoaled;<br>\r\n",
      "the sea broke and surged in sharp cones; the little craft tippled<br>\r\n",
      "and yawed confusedly; the counter eddies twirled and whirled in<br>\r\n",
      "foaming concaves; and leaden clouds again hung their threatening<br>\r\n",

      "roared, and the anxious countenance of the mate, still guiding the<br>\r\n",
      "craft with a steady hand, seemed masked in watchfulness. His hand<br>\r\n",
      "remained firm to the helm, his eyes peered into the black prospect<br>\r\n",
      "ahead: but not a word did he utter.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "It was near ten o'clock, when a noise as of thunder rolling in the<br>\r\n",
      "distance, and re-echoing in booming accents, broke fearfully upon<br>\r\n",
      "their ears. The sea, every moment threatening to engulph the little<br>\r\n",
      "craft, to sweep its freight of human beings into eternity, and to<br>\r\n",
      "seal for ever all traces of their fate, was now the lesser enemy.<br>\r\n",
      "Not a word had escaped the lips of a being on board for several<br>\r\n",

      "near Franconia, and during the five days they had been in the boat<br>\r\n",
      "exhibited great sympathy and kindness of heart. He had served her<br>\r\n",

      "tenderness for the suffering which it were well if those in higher<br>\r\n",

      "through the lashing surge, over a high curling wave, and with a<br>\r\n",
      "fearful crash lay buried in the boiling sand. Agonising shrieks<br>\r\n",
      "sounded amid the rage of elements; and then fainter and fainter they<br>\r\n",

      "stories in their mouths.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "Stores,--for such is our good man's name-turning from the spot, says<br>\r\n",
      "daylight will disclose a different scene; with the wind as it is the<br>\r\n",
      "bodies will be drawn into the eddy on the point, and thrown ashore<br>\r\n",
      "by the under-current, for burial. \"Poor creatures! there's no help<br>\r\n",

      "Stores has several times spoken of this good woman; were she a<br>\r\n",
      "ministering angel he could not speak of her name with more<br>\r\n",
      "reverence. For years, he tells us, has she been a harbinger of good,<br>\r\n",
      "ever relieving the sick and needy, cheering the downcast, protecting<br>\r\n",

      "When it became known that two witnesses to the dire misfortune had<br>\r\n",
      "been spared to tell the tale, and were now at Stores' house, the<br>\r\n",
      "excitement calmed into sympathy. The wrecker's little village<br>\r\n",

      "<br>\r\n",
      "Carefully they brought the dead bodies from the shore, and laid them<br>\r\n",
      "in an untenanted house, to await the coroner's order. Among them was<br>\r\n",
      "the slender form of Franconia, the dark dress in which she was clad<br>\r\n",
      "but little torn, and the rings yet remaining on her fingers. \"How<br>\r\n",
      "with fortitude she bore the suffering!\" said the rescued passenger,<br>\r\n",
      "gazing on her blanched features as they laid her on the floor: the<br>\r\n",
      "wrecker's wife covered her with a white sheet, and spread a pillow<br>\r\n",
      "carefully beneath her head.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes!\" returns the unfortunate seaman, who stood by his side, \"she<br>\r\n",
      "seemed of great goodness and gentleness. She said nothing, bore<br>\r\n",
      "everything without a murmur; she was Higgins' pet; and I'll lay he<br>\r\n",
      "died trying to save her, for never a braver fellow than Jack Higgins<br>\r\n",

      "three ladies-Stores' wife tells us they are of the Humane<br>\r\n",
      "Society-make their appearance in search of the deceased. They enter<br>\r\n",
      "Stores' house, greet his good dame familiarly, and remain seated<br>\r\n",
      "while she relates what has happened. One of the three is tall and<br>\r\n",
      "stately of figure, and dressed with that quiet taste so becoming a<br>\r\n",
      "lady. And while to the less observing eye no visible superiority<br>\r\n",
      "over the others is discernible, it is evident they view her in such<br>\r\n",
      "a light, always yielding to her counsels. Beneath a silk bonnet<br>\r\n",
      "trimmed with great neatness, is disclosed a finely oval face,<br>\r\n",
      "glowing with features of much regularity, large dark eyes of great<br>\r\n",
      "softness, and silky hair, laid in heavy wavy folds across a<br>\r\n",
      "beautifully arched brow-to which is added a sweet smile that ever<br>\r\n",
      "and anon plays over her slightly olive countenance. There, boldly<br>\r\n",
      "outlined, is the unmistakeable guide to a frank and gentle nature.<br>\r\n",
      "For several minutes does she listen to the honest woman's recital of<br>\r\n",
      "the sad event, which is suspended by the passenger making his<br>\r\n",
      "appearance. The wrecker's wife introduces him by motioning her hand,<br>\r\n",
      "and saying, \"This is the kind lady of whose goodness I spoke so last<br>\r\n",

      "incident of the voyage: this done, she will go to the house where<br>\r\n",
      "lay the dead, our good Dame Stores leading the way, talking from the<br>\r\n",
      "very honesty of her heart the while. In a small dilapidated dwelling<br>\r\n",
      "on the bleak sands, the dead lay. Children and old men linger about<br>\r\n",
      "the door,--now they make strange mutterings, and walk away, as if in<br>\r\n",
      "fear. Our messengers of mercy have entered the abode of the dead.<br>\r\n",
      "The wrecker's wife says, \"They are to be buried to-morrow, ma'am;\"<br>\r\n",
      "while the lady, with singular firmness, glances her eye along the<br>\r\n",
      "row of male bodies, counting them one by one. She has brought<br>\r\n",
      "shrouds, in which to bury them like Christians.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Them three females is here, ma'am,\" says Dame Stores, touching the<br>\r\n",
      "lady on the elbow, as she proceeds to uncover the bodies. The<br>\r\n",
      "passenger did, indeed, tell our Lady of Mercy there was one handsome<br>\r\n",
      "lady from Carolina. One by one she views their blanched and besanded<br>\r\n",
      "features.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"A bonny figure that, mum; I lay she's bin a handsome in her day,\"<br>\r\n",
      "with honest simplicity remarks Dame Stores, as, bent over the<br>\r\n",
      "lifeless body of Franconia, she turns back the sheet, carefully.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" is the quick reply: the philanthropic woman's keen eye scans<br>\r\n",
      "along the body from head to foot. Dame Stores will part the silken<br>\r\n",
      "hair from off that cold brow, and smooth it with her hand. Suddenly<br>\r\n",
      "our lady's eyes dart forth anxiety; she recognises some familiar<br>\r\n",
      "feature, and trembles. The rescued seaman had been quietly viewing<br>\r\n",
      "the bodies, as if to distinguish their different persons, when a<br>\r\n",
      "wrecker, who had assisted in removing the bodies, entered the room<br>\r\n",
      "and approached him, \"Ah!\" exclaims the seaman, suddenly, \"yonder's<br>\r\n",
      "poor Jack Higgins.\" He points to a besanded body at the right, the<br>\r\n",
      "arms torn and bent partly over the breast, adding, \"Jack had a good<br>\r\n",
      "heart, he had.\" Turning half round, the wrecker replies, \"That 'un<br>\r\n",
      "had this 'un fast grappled in his arms; it was a time afore we got<br>\r\n",
      "'um apart.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Was it this body?\" enquires the lady, looking at the lifeless form<br>\r\n",
      "before her. He says, \"That same, ma'am; an' it looked as if he had<br>\r\n",
      "tried to save the slender woman.\" He points to the body which Dame<br>\r\n",
      "Stores has just uncovered. The good lady kneels over the body: her<br>\r\n",
      "face suddenly becomes pale; her lips purple and quiver; she seems<br>\r\n",
      "sinking with nervous excitement, as tremulously she seizes the<br>\r\n",
      "blanched hand in her own. Cold and frigid, it will not yield to her<br>\r\n",
      "touch \"That face-those brows, those pearly teeth, those lips so<br>\r\n",
      "delicate,--those hands,--those deathless emblems! how like Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "they seem,\" she ejaculates frantically, the bystanders looking on<br>\r\n",
      "with surprise. \"And are they not my Franconia's-my dear<br>\r\n",
      "deliverer's?\" she continues. She smooths the cold hands, and chafes<br>\r\n",
      "them in her own. The rings thereon were a present from Marston.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Those features like unto chiselled marble are hers; I am not<br>\r\n",
      "deceived: no! oh no! it cannot be a dream\" (in sorrow she shakes her<br>\r\n",
      "head as the tears begin to moisten her cheeks), \"she received my<br>\r\n",
      "letter, and was on her way seeking me.\" Again she smooths and<br>\r\n",
      "smooths her left hand over those pallid cheeks, her right still<br>\r\n",
      "pressing the cold hand of the corpse, as her emotions burst forth in<br>\r\n",
      "agonising sobs.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The wrecker's wife loosens the dress from about deceased's<br>\r\n",
      "neck-bares that bosom once so fair and beautiful. A small locket,<br>\r\n",
      "attached to a plain black necklace, lies upon it, like a moat on a<br>\r\n",
      "snowy surface. Nervously does the good woman grasp it, and opening<br>\r\n",
      "it behold a miniature of Marston, a facsimile of which is in her own<br>\r\n",
      "possession. \"Somethin' more 'ere, mum,\" says Dame Stores, drawing<br>\r\n",

      "Franconia! she who was my saviour; she it was who snatched me from<br>\r\n",

      "wealth that he only hoped it might be his fortune to receive many<br>\r\n",
      "more such enemies of the state: he cared not whether they came from<br>\r\n",

      "break forth like a tempest: he rushed from his place of labour,<br>\r\n",
      "vaulted as it were to the guard gate, seized the woman as she<br>\r\n",

      "unmistakeable evidence of fear and anxiety, as it sweeps along the<br>\r\n",
      "streets. Now the grotesque group is bespotted with forms half<br>\r\n",

      "loosely over her shoulders, and her face bathed in tears. With<br>\r\n",

      "for treble the number dead of our hero's band. In the savage<br>\r\n",
      "conflict did the woman receive a fatal bullet, and now lies writhing<br>\r\n",
      "in the agonies of death (a victim of oppression in a land of<br>\r\n",
      "liberty) at our hero's feet. Not a moment is there to spare, that he<br>\r\n",
      "may soothe her dying agonies, for a thundering at the great gates is<br>\r\n",
      "heard, the bristling of fire-arms falls upon his ear, and the drums<br>\r\n",

      "into the soldiery, scatter it in amazement, and sweep triumphantly<br>\r\n",

      "dashed before its angry mouth, and at the top of his voice cried<br>\r\n",

      "galloping to the trail, the gunner standing motionless at the<br>\r\n",

      "the fellow that the matter might be reconciled with golden eagles,<br>\r\n",

      "look upon her as a being elevated above that menial sphere his<br>\r\n",

      "nearly at the same time was Montague summoned to New Orleans to<br>\r\n",

      "Montague set out on his journey; but had not been forty-eight hours<br>\r\n",
      "gone, when Finch again made his appearance, and taking advantage of<br>\r\n",
      "a husband's absence, pressed his advances with grossest insult,<br>\r\n",
      "threatening at the same time to convey information of the discovery<br>\r\n",
      "to Pringle Blowers. Successively did these importunities fail to<br>\r\n",
      "effect Mr. Finch's purpose; but he was of an indomitable temper, and<br>\r\n",
      "had strong faith in that maxim of his race, which may be transcribed<br>\r\n",
      "thus:--\"If one effort fail you, try another.\" To carry out this<br>\r\n",
      "principle, then, did Finch draw from the cunning inventive of his<br>\r\n",
      "brain a plan which he could not doubt for a moment would be<br>\r\n",
      "successful. The reader may blush while we record the fact, of Finch,<br>\r\n",
      "deeming a partner necessary to the gaining his purpose, finding a<br>\r\n",
      "willing accomplice in one of Montague's clerks, to whom he disclosed<br>\r\n",
      "the secret of the fair woman being nothing more than a fugitive<br>\r\n",
      "slave, whose shame they would share if the plan proved successful.<br>\r\n",
      "This ingenious plan, so old that none but a fellow of this stamp<br>\r\n",
      "would have adopted it, was nothing more than the intercepting by the<br>\r\n",
      "aid of the clerk all Montague's letters to his wife. By this they<br>\r\n",
      "came in possession of the nature of his family affairs; and after<br>\r\n",

      "themselves of her answers that they might be the better able to<br>\r\n",
      "carry out the evil of their scheme. After sufficient time had<br>\r\n",
      "passed, did Sylvia receive a letter, duly posted at New Orleans,<br>\r\n",
      "purporting to have been written by a clerk in the employ of the<br>\r\n",
      "firm, and informing her, having acknowledged becomingly the receipt<br>\r\n",
      "of her letter, that Montague had been seized with the epidemic, and<br>\r\n",
      "now lay in a precarious state. Much concerned was she at the painful<br>\r\n",
      "intelligence; but she almost as soon found consolation in the<br>\r\n",
      "assurances of the clerk who brought her the letter, and, to<br>\r\n",
      "strengthen his own cause, told her he had seen a captain just<br>\r\n",
      "arrived up, who had met her husband a day after the date of the<br>\r\n",
      "letter, quite well. Indeed, this was necessary to that functionary's<br>\r\n",
      "next move, for he was the conspirator of Finch, and the author of<br>\r\n",
      "the letter which had caused so much sadness to the woman who now<br>\r\n",
      "sought his advice. In suspense did the anxious woman wait the coming<br>\r\n",
      "tidings of her affectionate husband: alas! in a few days was the sad<br>\r\n",
      "news of his death by the fatal scourge brought to her in an envelope<br>\r\n",
      "with broad black border and appropriate seal. Overwhelmed with<br>\r\n",
      "grief, the good woman read the letter, describing her Montague to<br>\r\n",

      "confidential clerk of the firm had again performed a painful and<br>\r\n",
      "unexpected duty. The good man died, said he, invoking a blessing on<br>\r\n",
      "the head of his child, and asking heaven to protect his wife; to<br>\r\n",
      "which he would add, that the affairs of the house were in the worst<br>\r\n",
      "possible condition, there not being assets to pay a fraction of the<br>\r\n",
      "debts. And here we would beg the reader to use his imagination, and<br>\r\n",
      "save us the description of much that followed. Not all their threats<br>\r\n",
      "nor persuasions, however, could induce her to yield to their<br>\r\n",
      "designs; defiantly did she repulse the advances of the crawling<br>\r\n",
      "Finch; nobly did she spurn his persuasions; firmly did she, heedless<br>\r\n",
      "of his threat to acquaint Pringle Blowers of her whereabouts, bid<br>\r\n",
      "him be gone from her door. The fellow did go, grievously<br>\r\n",
      "disappointed; and, whether from malice or mercenary motives we will<br>\r\n",

      "with his fair slave to Charleston (which said slave he would not<br>\r\n",

      "firmly knit frame, to which were added hard and weather-stained<br>\r\n",
      "features, indicated his having seen some fifty summers. But, if he<br>\r\n",
      "was brusque of figure and coarse of deportment, he had a good soft<br>\r\n",
      "heart in the right place; nor did he fail to exercise its virtues<br>\r\n",
      "while pursuing the duties of a repulsive profession; albeit, he was<br>\r\n",
      "keeper of the establishment, and superintended all punishments.<br>\r\n",
      "Leisurely he smoked of a black pipe; and with shirt sleeves rolled<br>\r\n",
      "up, a grey felt hat almost covering his dark, flashing eyes, and his<br>\r\n",
      "arms easily folded, did he seem contemplating the calm loveliness of<br>\r\n",
      "morning. Now he exhaled the curling fume, then scanned away over the<br>\r\n",
      "bright landscape to the east, and again cast curious glances up and<br>\r\n",
      "down the broad road stretching in front of his prison to the north<br>\r\n",
      "and south. It was not long before a carriage and pair appeared on<br>\r\n",
      "the hill to the south, advancing at a slow pace towards the city.<br>\r\n",
      "The keeper's keen eye rested upon it intently, as it neared, bearing<br>\r\n",
      "in a back seat what seemed to be a lady fine of figure and<br>\r\n",
      "deportment; while on the front drove a figure of great rotundity,<br>\r\n",
      "the broad, full face shining out like a ripe pumpkin in a sun<br>\r\n",
      "shower. \"It's Pringle Blowers, I do believe in my soul! but it's<br>\r\n",
      "seeming strange how he's got a lady to ride with him,\" mused the<br>\r\n",
      "man, who, still watching the approach, had quite forgotten the<br>\r\n",
      "escape of the fair slave. The man was not mistaken, for as he<br>\r\n",
      "touched his hat, on the carriage arriving opposite the gate, it<br>\r\n",
      "halted, and there, sure enough, was our valiant democrat, who,<br>\r\n",
      "placing his whip in the socket, crooked his finger and beckoned the<br>\r\n",
      "keeper. \"Broadman!\" said he, (for that was the man's name) \"I'ze a<br>\r\n",
      "bit of something in your way of business this morning.\" The honest<br>\r\n",
      "functionary, with seeming surprise, again touching his hat as he<br>\r\n",
      "approached the vehicle, replied: \"Your servant, sir!\" Blowers<br>\r\n",
      "motioned his hand to the woman, whose tears were now, to Broadman's<br>\r\n",
      "surprise, seen coursing down her pale cheeks. To use a vulgar<br>\r\n",
      "phrase, Broadman was entirely \"taken aback\" by the singularity of<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers' manner; for the woman, whose dress and deportment the<br>\r\n",
      "honest man conceived to be nothing less than that of a lady of one<br>\r\n",
      "of the \"first families,\" obeying the motion, began to descend from<br>\r\n",
      "the carriage. \"Now, Broadman,\" continued Blowers, arranging his<br>\r\n",
      "reins, and with clumsy air making his descent over the fore wheels,<br>\r\n",
      "\"take that 'ar wench o' mine, and, by the State's custom, give her<br>\r\n",
      "the extent of the law, well laid on.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "The author here writes the incident as given by the prison-keeper.<br>\r\n",
      "The man hesitated, as if doubting his senses; rather would he have<br>\r\n",
      "been courteous to what he still viewed as a lady, than extend his<br>\r\n",
      "rude hand to lead her away.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me, Sir! but you cannot mean what you say,\" nervously spoke<br>\r\n",
      "the man, as in doubt he exchanged glances first with the fair woman<br>\r\n",
      "and then with Blowers. \"I means just what I says,\" returned that<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman, peremptorily; \"you'ze hearn o' that 'un afore. She's a<br>\r\n",
      "nigger o' mine, what runned away more nor six years ago; come, do<br>\r\n",
      "the job for her, and no fussing over't.\" \"Nigger!\" interrupted the<br>\r\n",
      "man, in surprise. \"Yes!\" rejoined Blowers, emphasising his assurance<br>\r\n",
      "with oaths, of which he had a never-failing supply, \"that's the<br>\r\n",
      "cussed white nigger what's gin me all the bother. The whiter niggers<br>\r\n",
      "is, the more devil's in em; and that ar' one's got devil enough for<br>\r\n",
      "a whole plantation; 'tisn't the licks I cares about, but it's the<br>\r\n",
      "humblin' on her feelings by being punished in the workhouse!\" The<br>\r\n",
      "man of duty was now brought to his senses, when, seeing Blowers was<br>\r\n",
      "inclined to relieve his anger on what he was pleased to consider the<br>\r\n",
      "stupidity of a keeper, he took the weeping but resolute woman by the<br>\r\n",
      "arm, and called a negro attendant, into whose charge he handed her,<br>\r\n",
      "with an order to \"put her in the slings.\" Soon she disappeared<br>\r\n",
      "within the gate, following the mulatto man. And here we will again<br>\r\n",
      "spare the reader's feelings, by omitting much that followed. Blowers<br>\r\n",
      "and Broadman follow the hapless woman, as she proceeds through a<br>\r\n",
      "narrow passage leading to the punishment room, and when about half<br>\r\n",
      "way to that place of torture, a small, square door opens on the<br>\r\n",
      "right, into a dingy office, the keeper says is where he keeps his<br>\r\n",
      "accounts with the State, which derives a large revenue from the<br>\r\n",
      "punishments. Into this does the worthy man invite his patron, whom<br>\r\n",
      "he would have be seated while the criminal is got \"all right\" in the<br>\r\n",
      "slings. Fain would Blowers go and attend the business himself; but<br>\r\n",
      "Broadman saying \"that cannot be,\" he draws from his pocket a small<br>\r\n",
      "flask, and, seemingly contented, invites him to join in \"somethin\"<br>\r\n",
      "he says is the very choicest. Broadman has no objection to<br>\r\n",
      "encouraging this evidence of good feeling, which he will take<br>\r\n",
      "advantage of to introduce the dialogue that follows. \"Good sir,\"<br>\r\n",
      "says he, \"you will pardon what I am about to say, for indeed I feel<br>\r\n",
      "the weakness of my position when addressing you, fortune having made<br>\r\n",
      "a wide distinction between us; but judge me not because I am coarse<br>\r\n",
      "of flesh, nor have polished manners, for I have a heart that feels<br>\r\n",
      "for the unfortunate.\" Here Blowers interrupted the keeper by saying<br>\r\n",
      "he would hear no chicken-hearted interpositions. \"Remember, keeper,\"<br>\r\n",
      "he added, \"you must not presume on the small familiarity I have<br>\r\n",
      "condescended to admit in drinking with you. I hold no controversies<br>\r\n",
      "with prison-keepers (again he gulps his brandy) or their subs; being<br>\r\n",
      "a servant of the state, I order you to give that wench the extent of<br>\r\n",
      "the law. She shall disclose the secret of her escape, or I'll have<br>\r\n",
      "her life; I'm a man what won't stand no nonsense, I am!\" The keeper,<br>\r\n",
      "rejoining, hopes he will pardon the seeming presumption; but,<br>\r\n",
      "forsooth, notwithstanding necessity has driven him to seek a<br>\r\n",
      "livelihood in his repulsive occupation, there is a duty of the heart<br>\r\n",
      "he cannot betray, though the bread of his maintenance be taken from<br>\r\n",
      "him. Blowers again assumes his dignity, rises from his seat, scowls<br>\r\n",
      "significantly at the keeper, and says he will go put through the<br>\r\n",
      "business with his own hands. \"Good friend,\" says Broadman, arresting<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers' progress, \"by the state's ruling you are my patron;<br>\r\n",
      "nevertheless, within these walls I am master, and whatever you may<br>\r\n",
      "bring here for punishment shall have the benefit of my discretion. I<br>\r\n",
      "loathe the law that forces me to, in such cases, overrule the admo-<br>\r\n",
      "nitions of my heart. I, sir, am low of this world,--good! but, in<br>\r\n",
      "regret do I say it, I have by a slave mother two fair daughters, who<br>\r\n",
      "in the very core of my heart I love; nor would I, imitating the<br>\r\n",

      "life.\" Here Blowers again interrupted by allowing his passion to<br>\r\n",
      "manifest itself in a few very fashionable oaths; to which he added,<br>\r\n",
      "that he (pacing the room several times) would no longer give ear to<br>\r\n",
      "such nonsense from a man of Broadman's position,--which was neither<br>\r\n",
      "socially nor politically grand. \"No doubt, good sir, my humble and<br>\r\n",
      "somewhat repulsive calling does not meet your distinguished<br>\r\n",

      "to say-I hope you will grant me a hearing-was, that having these two<br>\r\n",
      "daughters-poverty only prevents my purchasing them-has made me<br>\r\n",
      "sensible of these slaves having delicate textures. The unhappy<br>\r\n",
      "possession of these daughters has caused me to reflect-to study<br>\r\n",
      "constitutions, and their capacity to endure punishments. The woman<br>\r\n",
      "it has pleased you to bring here for chastisement, I take it, is not<br>\r\n",
      "coarse of flesh; but is one of those unfortunates whom kindness<br>\r\n",
      "might reform, while the lash never fails to destroy. Why, then, not<br>\r\n",
      "consider her in the light of a friendless wretch, whom it were<br>\r\n",
      "better to save, than sink in shame? One word more and I am done\"<br>\r\n",
      "(Blowers was about to cut short the conversation); \"the extent of<br>\r\n",
      "the law being nothing less than twenty blows of the paddle, is most<br>\r\n",

      "these blows: no, my lips never spoke truer when I say she'll quiver<br>\r\n",
      "and sink in spasms ere the second blow is laid on.\" Here-some twenty<br>\r\n",
      "minutes having passed since the fair slave was led into the<br>\r\n",
      "punishment room-Blowers cut short the conversation which had failed<br>\r\n",
      "to thaw his resolution, by saying Broadman had bored his ears in<br>\r\n",
      "spinning out his long song, and if he were unwilling to fulfil the<br>\r\n",
      "duties of his office, such should be reported to the authorities,<br>\r\n",
      "who would not permit workhouse-keepers so to modify their ordnances<br>\r\n",

      "says the honest man, with an air of earnestness, as he rises from<br>\r\n",
      "his seat; \"follow me, and with the reality will I prove the truth of<br>\r\n",
      "my words.\" Here he proceeds to that place of torments, the<br>\r\n",
      "punishment-room, followed by Blowers; who says, with singular<br>\r\n",
      "indifference-\"Can do the job in five minutes; then I'll leave her<br>\r\n",
      "with you for two, three, or four days or so. Then if she's civilly<br>\r\n",
      "humbled down, I'll send my nigger fellow, Joe, with an order for<br>\r\n",
      "her. Joe'll be the fellow's name; now, mind that: but you know my<br>\r\n",
      "Joe, I reckon?\" The keeper led the way, but made no reply; for<br>\r\n",
      "indeed he knew nothing of his Joe, there being innumerable niggers<br>\r\n",
      "of that name. As the men left the little office, and were sauntering<br>\r\n",
      "up the passage, our worthy friend Rosebrook might be seen entering<br>\r\n",
      "in search of Broadman; when, discovering Blowers in his company, and<br>\r\n",
      "hearing the significant words, he shot into a niche, unobserved by<br>\r\n",
      "them, and calling a negro attendant, learned the nature of his<br>\r\n",
      "visit. And here it becomes necessary that we discover to the reader<br>\r\n",
      "the fact of Rosebrook having been apprised of the forlorn woman's<br>\r\n",
      "return, and her perilous position in the hands of Pringle Blowers;<br>\r\n",
      "and, further, that the communication was effected by the negro man<br>\r\n",
      "Pompe, who we have before described in connection with Montague at<br>\r\n",
      "the time of his landing from the witch-like schooner. This Pompe was<br>\r\n",
      "sold to Blowers but a few months before Annette's recovery, and<br>\r\n",
      "acting upon the force of that sympathy which exists among fellow<br>\r\n",
      "slaves of a plantation, soon renewed old acquaintance, gained her<br>\r\n",
      "confidence, and, cunningly eluding the owner's watchfulness,<br>\r\n",
      "conveyed for her a letter to the Rosebrooks. In truth, Pompe had an<br>\r\n",
      "inveterate hatred of Blowers, and under the incitement would not<br>\r\n",
      "have hesitated to stake his life in defence of the fair woman. Now,<br>\r\n",
      "the exacting reader may question Rosebrook's intrepidity in not<br>\r\n",
      "proceeding at once to the rescue of the victim; but when we say that<br>\r\n",
      "he was ignorant of the positive order given the keeper, and only<br>\r\n",
      "caught distinctly the words-\"I'll send my nigger fellow, Joe, with<br>\r\n",
      "an order for her!\" they may discover an excuse for his hastily<br>\r\n",
      "withdrawing from the establishment. Indeed, that my reader may<br>\r\n",
      "withhold his censure, it may be well to add that he did this in<br>\r\n",
      "order to devise more strategical means of effecting her escape.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "And now, ye who have nerves-let them not be shaken; let not your<br>\r\n",
      "emotions rise, ye who have souls, and love the blessings of liberty;<br>\r\n",
      "let not mothers nor fathers weep over democracy's wrongs; nor let<br>\r\n",
      "man charge us with picturing the horrors of a black romance when we<br>\r\n",
      "introduce the spectacle in the room of punishments: such, be it<br>\r\n",
      "known, is not our business, nor would we trifle unjustly with the<br>\r\n",
      "errors of society; but, if chivalry have blushes, we do not object<br>\r\n",
      "to their being used here. The keeper, followed by Blowers, enters a<br>\r\n",
      "small room at the further end of the passage. It is some sixteen<br>\r\n",
      "feet long by twelve wide, and proportionately high of ceiling. The<br>\r\n",
      "pale light of a tallow candle, suspended from the ceiling by a wire,<br>\r\n",
      "and from which large flakes of the melted grease lay cone-like on<br>\r\n",
      "the pine floor, discloses the gloom, and discovers hanging from the<br>\r\n",
      "walls, grim with smoke, sundry curious caps, cords, leathern cats,<br>\r\n",
      "and the more improved paddles of wood, with flat blades. The very<br>\r\n",
      "gloom of the place might excite the timid; but the reflection of how<br>\r\n",
      "many tortures it has been the scene, and the mysterious stillness<br>\r\n",
      "pervading its singularly decorated walls, add still more to increase<br>\r\n",
      "apprehension. A plank, some two feet wide, and raised a few inches,<br>\r\n",
      "stretches across the floor, and is secured at each end with cleets.<br>\r\n",
      "About midway of this are ropes securing the victim's feet; and<br>\r\n",
      "through the dim light is disclosed the half nude body of our fair<br>\r\n",
      "girl, suspended by the wrists, which are clasped in bands of cord,<br>\r\n",
      "that, being further secured to a pulley block, is hauled taut by a<br>\r\n",
      "tackle. Suddenly the wretched woman gives vent to her feelings, and<br>\r\n",
      "in paroxysms of grief sways her poor body to and fro, imploring<br>\r\n",
      "mercy! \"Nay, master! think that I am a woman-that I have a heart to<br>\r\n",
      "feel and bleed; that I am a mother and a wife, though a slave. Let<br>\r\n",
      "your deeds be done quickly, or end me and save me this shame!\" she<br>\r\n",
      "supplicates, as the bitter, burning anguish of her goaded soul gives<br>\r\n",
      "out its flood of sorrow. Chivalry, forsooth, lies cold and<br>\r\n",
      "unmoved-Blowers has no relish for such inconsistency;--such whinings,<br>\r\n",
      "he says, will not serve southern principles. The mulatto attendant<br>\r\n",
      "has secured the fall, and stands a few feet behind Blowers and the<br>\r\n",
      "keeper, as that functionary says, laying his coarse hands on the<br>\r\n",
      "woman's loins, \"How silky!\" The mulatto man shakes his head,<br>\r\n",
      "revengefully, making a grimace, as Broadman, having selected the<br>\r\n",
      "smallest paddle (reminding us of the curious sympathy now budding<br>\r\n",
      "between the autocratic knout and democratic lash) again addresses<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers. \"I doubt, sir,\" he says, \"if the woman stand a blow.<br>\r\n",
      "Necessity 's a hard master, sir; and in this very act is the test<br>\r\n",
      "more trying than I have ever known it. I dissemble myself when I see<br>\r\n",
      "a wretch of fine flesh-a woman with tender senses, in distress, and<br>\r\n",
      "I am made the instrument of adding to her suffering. Indeed, sir,<br>\r\n",
      "when I contemplate the cause of such wretchedness, and the poverty<br>\r\n",
      "forcing me to remain in this situation, no imagination can represent<br>\r\n",
      "the horror of my feelings.\"<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"We have no demand on your feelings, my man! we want your duty-what<br>\r\n",
      "the state put you here to perform,\" interrupted Blowers, placing his<br>\r\n",
      "thumbs in his vest, and making a step backward. Another second, and<br>\r\n",
      "the attendant lighted a hand-lamp,--a sharp, slapping blow was heard,<br>\r\n",
      "a death-like shriek followed; the flesh quivered and contracted into<br>\r\n",
      "a discoloured and inflamed pustule; the body writhed a few seconds<br>\r\n",
      "in convulsive spasms; a low moaning followed, and that fair form<br>\r\n",
      "hung swooning in the slings, as the keeper, in fright, cried out, at<br>\r\n",
      "the top of his voice, to the attendant--\"Lower away the fall!\" As if<br>\r\n",
      "the fiend had not yet gratified his passion, no sooner was the<br>\r\n",
      "seemingly lifeless body lowered clumsily to the floor, than he<br>\r\n",
      "grasped the weapon from Broadman's hand, and like a tiger seeking<br>\r\n",
      "its banquet of flesh, was about to administer a second blow. But<br>\r\n",
      "Broadman had a good heart, the admonitions of which soared high<br>\r\n",
      "above the state's mandate: seizing Blowers in his arms, he ejected<br>\r\n",
      "him from the door, ran back to the prostrate woman, released her<br>\r\n",
      "bruised limbs from the fastenings, gathered her to his arms; and<br>\r\n",
      "with nervous hands and anxious face did he draw from his pocket the<br>\r\n",
      "well-timed hartshorn, by the application of which he sought to<br>\r\n",
      "restore her, as the mulatto man stood by, bathing her temples with<br>\r\n",
      "cold water. \"Ah! shame on the thing called a man who could abuse a<br>\r\n",
      "sweet creature of fine flesh, like thee! it's not many has such a<br>\r\n",
      "pretty sweet face,\" says Broadman, with an air of compassion,<br>\r\n",
      "resting her shoulder against his bended knee as he encircles it with<br>\r\n",
      "his left arm, and looks upon the pale features, tears glistening in<br>\r\n",
      "his honest eyes. We might say with Broadman--\"It's not the finest,<br>\r\n",
      "nor the polished of flesh, that hath the softest hearts.\" But,<br>\r\n",
      "reader, having performed our duty, let us drop the curtain over this<br>\r\n",

      "was delicate of figure, with pale, careworn countenance and nervous<br>\r\n",
      "demeanour. Upon the marble slab, on which they rested their elbows,<br>\r\n",
      "sat a bottle of old Madeira, from which they sipped leisurely, now<br>\r\n",

      "of brown features spoke out more at ease, as if they had concluded<br>\r\n",
      "the preliminaries of some important business.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "\"Well, well,--now isn't that strange?\" said he, sighing as he spread<br>\r\n",

      "though\" (he looked intently at the other): \"why, more nor twenty<br>\r\n",
      "years have rolled over since I did that bit of a good turn, and here<br>\r\n",
      "I is the very same old Jack Hardweather, skipper of the Maggy Bell.<br>\r\n",

      "Here the delicate man took the sailor's arm, and sallied out to seek<br>\r\n",
      "the little Maggy Bell, the former saying the meeting was as strange<br>\r\n",
      "as grateful to his very soul. Down Market Street, shaded in<br>\r\n",
      "darkness, they wended their way, and after reaching the wharf,<br>\r\n",
      "passed along between long lines of cotton bales, piled eight and ten<br>\r\n",
      "feet high, to the end, where lay motionless the pretty Maggy Bell,<br>\r\n",
      "as clipper-like a craft as ever spread canvas. The light from the<br>\r\n",
      "cabin shed its faint gleams over the quarter-deck, as Hardweather<br>\r\n",
      "halted on the capsill, and with a sailor's pride run his quick black<br>\r\n",
      "eye along her pirate-like hull, then aloft along the rigging.<br>\r\n",
      "Exultingly, he says, \"She is the sauciest witch that ever faced sea<br>\r\n",

      "on the shoulder-\"why, sir, she has-just between ourselves now-slided<br>\r\n",
      "many a poor slave off into freedom; but folks here don't think it of<br>\r\n",
      "me. Now, if I reckon right\"-he bites his tobacco, and extends it to<br>\r\n",
      "the stranger-\"and I believe I do, it's twenty years since the Maggy,<br>\r\n",

      "mass, scarce visible in the distance, to the east. \"And now she's<br>\r\n",

      "she's right comfortable off, now,--alwa's has a smile, and a kind<br>\r\n",
      "word, and something good for old Jack Hardweather whenever she sees<br>\r\n",
      "him. Lord bless yer soul!\"-here he shakes his head earnestly, and<br>\r\n",
      "says he never was a lubber-\"Jack Hardweather didn't care about the<br>\r\n",
      "soft shot for his locker; it was my heart that felt the kindness.<br>\r\n",

      "can take a trick at the wheel just as well as Harry Span the mate.\"<br>\r\n",
      "Skipper Splitwater leads the way into a little dingy cabin, a<br>\r\n",

      "Holding his hand, he says: \"Now, keep the heart up right! and in a<br>\r\n",
      "day or two we'll have all aboard, and be in the stream waiting for a<br>\r\n",

      "of a standing jib, and in my soul I believe she'd make the passage<br>\r\n",
      "without compass, chart, or a hand aboard. By the word of an old<br>\r\n",

      "were his suspicions unfounded; for, on returning to Memphis, which<br>\r\n",
      "he did in great haste, he found his home desolate, his wife and<br>\r\n",

      "satisfy the enraged man, by producing the very order on which he<br>\r\n",

      "forgery!-'tis, by the Eternal!\" Turning his fat sides, he approaches<br>\r\n",
      "the window, and by the light reads each successive word. It is<br>\r\n",

      "does he seek his way into the city, where he discovers his loss to<br>\r\n",
      "the police. We have in another part of our history described Blowers<br>\r\n",
      "as something of a wag; indeed, waggery was not the least trait in<br>\r\n",
      "his curious character, nor was he at all cautious in the exercise of<br>\r\n",
      "it; and, upon the principle that those who give must take, did he<br>\r\n",
      "render himself a fit object for those who indulge in that sort of<br>\r\n",
      "pastime to level their wit upon. On this occasion, Blowers had not<br>\r\n",
      "spent many hours in the city ere he had all its convenient corners<br>\r\n",
      "very fantastically decorated with large blue placards, whereon was<br>\r\n",
      "inscribed the loss of his valuable woman, and the offer of the<br>\r\n",
      "increased sum of four hundred dollars for her apprehension. The<br>\r\n",
      "placards were wonderful curiosities, and very characteristic of<br>\r\n",
      "Blowers, who in this instance excited no small amount of merriment<br>\r\n",
      "among the city wags, each of whom cracked a joke at his expense. Now<br>\r\n",
      "it was not that those waggish spirits said of his placard things<br>\r\n",
      "exceedingly annoying to his sensitive feelings, but that every prig<br>\r\n",
      "made him the butt of his borrowed wit. One quizzed him with want of<br>\r\n",
      "gallantry,--another told him what the ladies said of his oss,--a third<br>\r\n",
      "pitied him, but hoped he might get back his property; and then, Tom<br>\r\n",
      "Span, the dandy lawyer, laconically told him that to love a fair<br>\r\n",
      "slave was a business he must learn over again; and Sprout, the<br>\r\n",
      "cotton-broker, said there was a law against ornamenting the city<br>\r\n",
      "with blue placards and type of such uncommon size. In this<br>\r\n",
      "interminable perplexity, and to avoid the last-named difficulty, did<br>\r\n",
      "he invoke the genius of the \"bill-sticker,\" who obliterated the blue<br>\r\n",
      "placards by covering them over with brown ones, the performance of<br>\r\n",
      "which, Blowers himself superintended. This made the matter still<br>\r\n",
      "worse, for with jocose smile did every wag say he had hung the city<br>\r\n",
      "in mourning for his loss; which singular proceeding the ladies had<br>\r\n",
      "one and all solemnly protested against. Now, Blowers regard for the<br>\r\n",
      "ladies was proverbial; nor will it disparage his character to say<br>\r\n",
      "that no one was more sensitive of their opinions concerning himself.<br>\r\n",
      "In this unhappy position, then, which he might have avoided had he<br>\r\n",
      "exercised more calmly his philosophy, did his perturbation get the<br>\r\n",

      "ill-favour with the very first ladies, never was perplexed man's<br>\r\n",
      "temper so near the exploding point of high pressure. And here,<br>\r\n",
      "forsooth, disgusted within the whole city, nor at all pleased with<br>\r\n",
      "the result of his inventive genius, he sought relief in strong<br>\r\n",
      "drinks and a week of dissipation; in which sad condition we must<br>\r\n",
      "leave him to the reader's sympathy.<br>\r\n",
      "<br>\r\n",
      "As some of our fair readers may be a little prudish, or exacting of<br>\r\n",
      "character, and as we are peculiarly sensitive of the reputation some<br>\r\n",
      "of the characters embodied in this history should bear to the very<br>\r\n",

      "means by which it was so cleverly carried out, to the release of the<br>\r\n",
      "fair captives, who must now be got out of the city. Should we, in<br>\r\n",
      "the performance of this very desirable duty, fail to please the<br>\r\n",
      "reader's taste for hair-breadth escapes, unnatural heroism, and<br>\r\n",
      "sublime disinterestedness, an excuse may be found in our lack of<br>\r\n",

      "traffic in dramatic effects. But as the simplest strategy is often<br>\r\n",
      "the most successful of results, so did it prove in this particular<br>\r\n",
      "case; for, be it known, that on the morning of the twenty-fourth of<br>\r\n",
      "March,--, was Molly Hardweather's suggestion adopted and<br>\r\n",
      "effectually carried out, to the gratification of sundry interested<br>\r\n",
      "persons. Calm and bright was that morning; Charleston harbour and<br>\r\n",
      "its pretty banks seemed radiant of loveliness: the phantom-like<br>\r\n",
      "Maggy Bell, with mainsail and jib spread motionless in the air,<br>\r\n",
      "swung gently at anchor midway the stream; and Dame Hardweather sat<br>\r\n",
      "in the dingy cabin, her little chubby face beaming contentment as<br>\r\n",
      "she nursed the \"t'other twin.\" The brusque figure of old Jack,<br>\r\n",
      "immersed in watchfulness, paced to and fro the Maggy's deck; and in<br>\r\n",
      "the city as trim a young sailor as ever served signal halliards on<br>\r\n",
      "board man-o'-war, might be seen, his canvas bag slung over his<br>\r\n",
      "shoulder, carelessly plodding along through the busy street, for the<br>\r\n",
      "landing at the market slip. Soon the Maggy's flying jib was run up,<br>\r\n",
      "then the foresail followed and hung loose by the throat. Near the<br>\r\n",
      "wheel, as if in contemplation, sat Montague, while Hardweather<br>\r\n",
      "continued his pacing, now glancing aloft, then to seaward, as if<br>\r\n",
      "invoking Boreas' all-welcome aid, and again watching intently in the<br>\r\n",
      "direction of the slip. A few minutes more and a boat glided from the<br>\r\n",
      "wharf, and rowed away for the little craft, which it soon reached,<br>\r\n",
      "and on board of which the young sailor flung his bag, clambered over<br>\r\n",
      "the rail, and seemed happy, as old Jack put out his brawny hand,<br>\r\n",
      "saying: \"Come youngster, bear a hand now, and set about brightening<br>\r\n",
      "up the coppers!\" We need not here discover the hearts that leaped<br>\r\n",
      "with joy just then; we need not describe the anxiety that found<br>\r\n",

      "we describe those eyes on shore that in tears watched the slender<br>\r\n",
      "form as it disappeared from sight. Just then a breeze wafted from<br>\r\n",
      "the north, the anchor was hove up, the sails trimmed home, and<br>\r\n",
      "slowly seaward moved the little bark. As she drifted rather than<br>\r\n",
      "sailed past Fort Pinkney, two burly officials, as is the custom,<br>\r\n",
      "boarded to search for hapless fugitives; but, having great<br>\r\n",
      "confidence in the honesty of Skipper Splitwater, who never failed to<br>\r\n",
      "give them of his best cheer, they drank a pleasant passage to him,<br>\r\n",
      "made a cursory search, a note of the names of all on board (Jack<br>\r\n",
      "saying Tom Bolt was the young sailor's), and left quite satisfied.<br>\r\n",
      "Indeed, there was nothing to excite their suspicions, for the good<br>\r\n",

      "the young sailor, who it is hardly necessary to inform the reader is<br>\r\n",
      "Annette, was busy with his cooking. And now the little craft, free<br>\r\n",
      "upon the wave, increased her speed as her topsails spread out, and<br>\r\n",
      "glided swiftly seaward, heaven tempering the winds to her well-worn<br>\r\n",
      "sails. God speed the Maggy Bell as she vaults over the sea; and may<br>\r\n",

      "wedlock-was not the land of the puritans free? \"Nay!\" he answered,<br>\r\n",
      "in a measured tone, shaking his head, \"it is bestained not with<br>\r\n",
      "their crimes-for dearly do they love justice and regard the rights<br>\r\n",
      "of man-but with the dark deeds of the man-seller, who, heedless of<br>\r\n",
      "their feelings, and despising their moral rectitude, would make<br>\r\n",
      "solitary those happy homes that brighten in greatness over its<br>\r\n",
      "soil.\" Again, frantic of anxiety, did the woman interrupt him:<br>\r\n",
      "\"Heavens!-she is not dragged back into slavery?\" she enquired, her<br>\r\n",
      "emotions rising beyond her power of restraint, as she drew bitter<br>\r\n",

      "Montague return her solicitous glance, and speak. \"Into slavery\" he<br>\r\n",
      "muttered, in half choked accents \"was she hurled back.\" He had not<br>\r\n",
      "finished the sentence ere anxiety burst its bounds, and the anxious<br>\r\n",
      "woman shrieked, and fell swooning in his arms. Even yet her olive<br>\r\n",
      "face was beautefully pale. The cheerful parlour now rung with<br>\r\n",
      "confusion, servants bustled about in fright, the youthful family<br>\r\n",
      "shrieked in fear, the father sought to restore the fond mother, as<br>\r\n",
      "Montague chafed her right hand in his. Let us leave to the reader's<br>\r\n",
      "conjecture a scene his fancy may depict better than we can describe,<br>\r\n",
      "and pass to one more pleasant of results. Some half an hour had<br>\r\n",
      "transpired, when, as if in strange bewilderment, Clotilda opened her<br>\r\n",
      "eyes and seemed conscious of her position. A deep crimson shaded her<br>\r\n",
      "olive cheeks, as in luxurious ease she lay upon the couch, her<br>\r\n",
      "flushed face and her thick wavy hair, so prettily parted over her<br>\r\n",
      "classic brow, curiously contrasting with the snow-white pillow on<br>\r\n",
      "which it rested. A pale and emaciated girl sat beside her, smoothing<br>\r\n",
      "her brow with her left hand, laying the right gently on the almost<br>\r\n",
      "motionless bosom, kissing the crimsoning cheek, and lisping rather<br>\r\n",
      "than speaking, \"Mother, mother, oh mother!-it's only me.\" And then<br>\r\n",
      "the wet courses on her cheeks told how the fountain of her soul had<br>\r\n",
      "overflown. Calmly and vacantly the woman gazed on the fair girl,<br>\r\n",
      "with whom she had been left alone. Then she raised her left hand to<br>\r\n",
      "her brow, sighed, and seemed sinking into a tranquil sleep. \"Mother!<br>\r\n",
      "mother! I am once more with my mother!\" again ejaculates the fair<br>\r\n",
      "girl, sobbing audibly; \"do you not know me, mother?\" Clotilda<br>\r\n",
      "started as if suddenly surprised. \"Do I dream?\" she muttered,<br>\r\n",
      "raising herself on her elbow, as her great soft eyes wandered about<br>\r\n",
      "the room. She would know who called her mother. \"'Tis me,\" said the<br>\r\n",
      "fair girl, returning her glances, \"do you not know your Annette-your<br>\r\n",
      "slave child?\" Indeed the fair girl was not of that bright<br>\r\n",
      "countenance she had anticipated meeting, for though the punishment<br>\r\n",
      "had little soiled her flesh the dagger of disgrace had cut deep into<br>\r\n",
      "her heart, and spread its poison over her soul. \"This my Annette!\"<br>\r\n",
      "exclaimed Clotilda, throwing her arms about the fair girl's neck,<br>\r\n",
      "drawing her frantically to her bosom, and bathing her cheeks with<br>\r\n",
      "her tears of joy. \"Yes, yes, 'tis my long-lost child; 'tis she for<br>\r\n",
      "whom my soul has longed-God has been merciful, rescued her from the<br>\r\n",
      "yawning death of slavery, and given her back to her mother! Oh, no,<br>\r\n",
      "I do not dream-it is my child,--my Annette!\" she continued. Long and<br>\r\n",
      "affectionately did they mingle their tears and kisses. And now a<br>\r\n",
      "fond mother's joy seemed complete, a child's sorrow ended, and a<br>\r\n",
      "happy family were made happier. Again the family gathered into the<br>\r\n",
      "room, where, as of one accord, they poured out their affectionate<br>\r\n",
      "congratulations. One after another were the children enjoined to<br>\r\n",
      "greet Annette, kiss her, and call her sister. To them the meeting<br>\r\n",
      "was as strange as to the parents it was radiant of joy. \"Mother!\"<br>\r\n",
      "said the little boy, as he took Annette by the hand and called her<br>\r\n",
      "sister, and kissed her as she kissed him, \"was you married before<br>\r\n",
      "you was married to father?\" The affectionate mother had no answer to<br>\r\n",
      "make; she might have found one in the ignominy of the slave world.<br>\r\n",
      "And now, when the measure of joy seemed full-when the bitterness of<br>\r\n",
      "the past dwindled away like a dream, and when the future like a<br>\r\n",
      "beacon hung out its light of promise,--Clotilda drew from a small<br>\r\n",
      "workstand a discoloured paper written over in Greek characters,<br>\r\n",
      "scarce intelligible. \"Annette!\" said she, \"my mother gave me this<br>\r\n",
      "when last I saw her. The chains were then about her hands, and she<br>\r\n",
      "was about to be led away to the far south slave market: by it did I<br>\r\n",
      "discover my history.\" Here she unfolded its defaced pages, lifted<br>\r\n",
      "her eyes upwards invokingly, and continued--\"To speak the crimes of<br>\r\n",
      "great men is to hazard an oblivion for yourself, to bring upon you<br>\r\n",
      "the indifference of the multitude; but great men are often greatest<br>\r\n",

      "Florida was by the king of Spain ceded to Great Britain) emigrated<br>\r\n",
      "with one Dr. Turnbull-whose name has since shone on the pages of<br>\r\n",
      "history-to that land of sunshine and promise; for, indeed, Florida<br>\r\n",
      "is the Italy of America. In that year did numerous of the English<br>\r\n",

      "government, and, for the sum of four hundred pounds, (being then in<br>\r\n",
      "the Peleponnesus) was the governor of Modon bribed into a permission<br>\r\n",
      "to convey sundry Greek families to Florida, for colonization.<br>\r\n",
      "Returning from Modon with a number of families, he touched at the<br>\r\n",

      "and increased the number of his settlers to fifteen hundred. With<br>\r\n",
      "exciting promises did he decoy them to his land of Egypt, which<br>\r\n",
      "proved a bondage to his shame. He would give them lands, free<br>\r\n",
      "passages, good provisions and clothing; but none of these promises<br>\r\n",
      "did he keep. A long passage of four months found many victims to its<br>\r\n",
      "hardships, and those who arrived safe were emaciated by sickness.<br>\r\n",
      "Into the interior were these taken; and there they founded a<br>\r\n",
      "settlement called New Smyrna, the land for which-some sixty thousand<br>\r\n",

      "earnestly did they labour for the promised reward, and in less than<br>\r\n",
      "five years had more than three thousand acres of land in the highest<br>\r\n",

      "did the demon avarice; and men, women, and children, were reduced to<br>\r\n",
      "the most abject slavery. Tasks greater than they could perform were<br>\r\n",
      "assigned them, and a few Italians and negroes made overseers and<br>\r\n",
      "drivers. For food the labourers were allotted seven quarts of corn<br>\r\n",
      "per week. Many who had lived in affluence in their own country were<br>\r\n",
      "compelled to wear osnaburgs, and go bare-foot through the year. More<br>\r\n",
      "than nine years were those valuable settlers kept in this state of<br>\r\n",
      "slavery, the cruelties inflicted upon them surpassing in enormity<br>\r\n",
      "those which so stigmatised the savage Spaniards of St. Domingo.<br>\r\n",

      "trees, that mosquitoes might suck their blood, and the suffering<br>\r\n",
      "wretches become swollen from torture. Some, to end their troubles,<br>\r\n",
      "wandered off, and died of starvation in the forest, and, including<br>\r\n",
      "the natural increase, less than six hundred souls were left at the<br>\r\n",
      "end of nine years. But, be it known to those whose hearts and ears I<br>\r\n",
      "have before invoked, that many children of these unfortunate parents<br>\r\n",
      "were fair and beautiful, which valuable charms singularly excited<br>\r\n",

      "being quick of ear, conveyed the purport of it to his mother, who,<br>\r\n",
      "in the night, summoned a council of her confidants to concoct the<br>\r\n",
      "means of gaining more intelligence. The boy heard the visitors, who<br>\r\n",
      "stood in the great mansion, which was of stone, say, \"Did the<br>\r\n",
      "wretches know their rights they had not suffered such enormities of<br>\r\n",

      "the envoys, who bore good tidings, did they meet in secret, and<br>\r\n",
      "choose one Pallicier, a Greek, their leader. This man had been<br>\r\n",

      "armed and formed into two lines, the women, children, and old men in<br>\r\n",

      "seek freedom. In vain did the tyrant-whose name democracy has<br>\r\n",
      "enshrined with its glories-pursue them, and exhaust persuasion to<br>\r\n",
      "procure their return. For three days did they wander the woods,<br>\r\n",

      "a life of infamy, and for whose offspring, now in the bitterness of<br>\r\n",
      "bondage, do we plead. Scores of these female children were sold by<br>\r\n",

      "long silvery beard, and a flowing moustache, all shaded by the broad<br>\r\n",
      "brim of a black felt hat, lent their aid to make impressive. Closer<br>\r\n",
      "he muffled his face in the folds of his cloak, and spoke. \"Time!\"<br>\r\n",

      "whole, did indeed make the scene resplendent of luxury. The man<br>\r\n",
      "carelessly seated himself at a table that stood in the centre of the<br>\r\n",
      "room, threw the hat he had declined yielding to the negro on the<br>\r\n",
      "floor beside him, rested the elbow of his left arm on the table, and<br>\r\n",
      "his head in his hand, as with the fingers of his right hand did he<br>\r\n",
      "fret the long silvery beard that bedecked his chin, and contemplate<br>\r\n",
      "with eager gaze the scene around him. \"Yea, the man-seller hath,<br>\r\n",
      "with his spoils of greed, gotten him a gorgeous mansion; even he<br>\r\n",
      "liveth like a prince, his head resteth more in peace, and because he<br>\r\n",
      "hath great wealth of crime men seek to honour him. The rich criminal<br>\r\n",
      "hath few to fear; but hard is the fate of him who hath not the<br>\r\n",
      "wherewith to be aught but a poor one!\" he muttered to himself, as<br>\r\n",
      "the door opened, and the well-rounded figure of Graspum whisked into<br>\r\n",
      "the room. The negro bowed politely, and closed the door after him,<br>\r\n",
      "as the stranger's eye flashed upon his old acquaintance, who,<br>\r\n",
      "bedecked somewhat extravagantly, and with a forced smile on his<br>\r\n",
      "subtle countenance, advanced rubbing his hands one over the other,<br>\r\n",
      "making several methodical bows, to which the stranger rose, as he<br>\r\n",
      "said, \"Most happy am I to see you, Major! Major Blake, I believe, I<br>\r\n",
      "have the pleasure of receiving?\" Here the stranger interpolated by<br>\r\n",
      "saying his name was not Blake, but Blank: the other apologised, said<br>\r\n",
      "he was just entertaining a small but very select circle of friends;<br>\r\n",
      "nevertheless, always chose to follow the maxim of \"business before<br>\r\n",
      "pleasure.\" Again he bustled about, worked his fingers with a<br>\r\n",
      "mechanical air, frisked them through his hair, with which he covered<br>\r\n",
      "the bald surface of his head, kept his little keen eyes leering<br>\r\n",
      "apprehensively on what he deemed a ripe customer, whom he bid keep<br>\r\n",
      "his seat. To an invitation to lay off his cloak the stranger replied<br>\r\n",
      "that it was of no consequence. \"A planter just locating, if I may be<br>\r\n",
      "permitted to suggest?\" enquired Graspum, taking his seat on the<br>\r\n",
      "opposite side of the table. \"No!\" returned the other, emphatically;<br>\r\n",
      "\"but I have some special business in your line.\" The man of<br>\r\n",
      "business, his face reddening of anxiety, rose quickly from his seat,<br>\r\n",
      "advanced to what seemed a rosewood cabinet elaborately carved, but<br>\r\n",
      "which was in reality an iron safe encased with ornamental wood, and<br>\r\n",
      "from it drew forth a tin case, saying, as he returned and set it<br>\r\n",
      "upon the table, \"Lots from one to five were sold yesterday at almost<br>\r\n",
      "fabulous prices-never was the demand for prime people better; but we<br>\r\n",
      "have Lots (here he began to disgorge invoices) six, seven, eight,<br>\r\n",
      "and nine left; all containing the primest of people! Yes, sir, let<br>\r\n",
      "me assure you, the very choicest of the market.\" He would have the<br>\r\n",
      "customer examine the invoices himself, and in the morning the live<br>\r\n",
      "stock may be seen at his yard. \"You cherish no evil in your breast,<br>\r\n",
      "in opposition to the command of Him who reproved the wrong of<br>\r\n",
      "malice; but you still cling to the sale of men, which you conceive<br>\r\n",
      "no harm, eh, Graspum?\" returned the stranger, knitting his brows, as<br>\r\n",
      "a curl of fierce hatred set upon his lip. With an air of surprise<br>\r\n",
      "did Graspum hesitate for a moment, and then, with a measured smile,<br>\r\n",
      "said, \"Why, Lord bless you! it would be a dishonour for a man of my<br>\r\n",
      "celebrity in business to let a day escape without a sale; within the<br>\r\n",
      "last ten days I have sold a thousand people, or more,--provided you<br>\r\n",
      "throw in the old ones!\" Here he again frisked his fingers, and<br>\r\n",
      "leaned back in his chair, as his face resumed an air of<br>\r\n",
      "satisfaction. The stranger interrupted as the man-seller was about<br>\r\n",
      "to enquire the number and texture of the people he desired.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Graspum,\" said he, with significant firmness, setting his eyes upon<br>\r\n",
      "him with intense stare,--\"I want neither your men, nor your women,<br>\r\n",
      "nor your little children; but, have you a record of souls you have<br>\r\n",
      "sunk in the bitterness of slavery in that box\"-here the stranger<br>\r\n",
      "paused, and pointed at the box on the table-\"keep it until you knock<br>\r\n",
      "for admittance at the gates of eternity.\" It was not until this<br>\r\n",
      "moment that he could bring his mind, which had been absorbed in the<br>\r\n",
      "mysteries of man-selling, to regard the stranger in any other light<br>\r\n",
      "than that of a customer. \"Pardon me, sir!\" said he, somewhat<br>\r\n",
      "nervously, \"but you speak with great familiarity.\" The stranger<br>\r\n",
      "would not be considered intrusive. \"Then you have forgotten me,<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum?\" exclaimed the man, with an ominous laugh. As if deeply<br>\r\n",
      "offended at such familiarity, the man-seller shook his head<br>\r\n",
      "rebukingly, and replied by saying he had an advantage of him not<br>\r\n",
      "comprehensible. \"Then have you sent my dearest relatives to an<br>\r\n",
      "untimely grave, driven me from the home of my childhood, and made a<br>\r\n",
      "hundred wretches swim a sea of sorrow; and yet you do not know me?\"<br>\r\n",
      "Indeed, the charges here recounted would have least served to aid<br>\r\n",
      "the recognition, for they belonged only to one case among many<br>\r\n",
      "scores that might have been enumerated. He shook his head in reply.<br>\r\n",
      "For a minute did they,--the stranger scowling sarcastically upon his<br>\r\n",
      "adversary (for such he now was),--gaze upon each other, until<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum's eyes drooped and his face turned pale. \"I have seen you;<br>\r\n",
      "but at this moment cannot place you,\" he replied, drawing back his<br>\r\n",
      "chair a pace. \"It were well had you never known me!\" was the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger's rejoinder, spoken in significant accents, as he<br>\r\n",
      "deliberately drew from beneath his cloak a revolver, which he laid<br>\r\n",
      "on the table, warning his adversary that it were well he move<br>\r\n",
      "cautiously. Graspum affects not to comprehend such importune<br>\r\n",
      "demeanor, or conjecture what has brought him hither. Trembling in<br>\r\n",
      "fright, and immersed in the sweat of his cowardice, he would<br>\r\n",
      "proclaim aloud his apprehension; to which medium of salvation he<br>\r\n",
      "makes an attempt to reach the door. But the stranger is too quick<br>\r\n",
      "for him: \"Calm your fears, Graspum,\" he says; \"act not the child,<br>\r\n",
      "but meet the consequences like a hero: strange is it, that you, who<br>\r\n",
      "have sold twenty thousand souls, should shrink at the yielding up of<br>\r\n",
      "one life!\" concludes he, placing his back firmly against the door,<br>\r\n",
      "and commanding Graspum to resume his seat. Having locked the door<br>\r\n",
      "and placed the key in his pocket, he paced twice or thrice up and<br>\r\n",
      "down the floor, seemingly in deep contemplation, and heaved a sigh.<br>\r\n",
      "\"Graspum!\" he ejaculated, suddenly turning towards that terrified<br>\r\n",
      "gentleman; \"in that same iron chest have you another box, the same<br>\r\n",
      "containing papers which are to me of more value than all your<br>\r\n",
      "invoices of souls. Go! bring it hither!\" Tremblingly did the<br>\r\n",
      "man-seller obey the command, drew from the chest an antiquated box,<br>\r\n",
      "and placed it hesitatingly upon the table. \"I will get the key, if<br>\r\n",
      "you will kindly permit me,\" he said, bowing, as the sweat fell from<br>\r\n",
      "his chin upon the carpet. The stranger says it wants no key; he<br>\r\n",
      "breaks it open with his hands. \"You have long stored it with goodly<br>\r\n",
      "papers; let us see of what they are made,\" said he. Here Graspum<br>\r\n",
      "commenced drawing forth package after package of papers, the<br>\r\n",
      "inscriptions on which were eagerly observed by the stranger's keen<br>\r\n",
      "eye. At length there came out a package of letters, superscribed in<br>\r\n",
      "the stranger's own hand, and directed to Hugh Marston. \"How came you<br>\r\n",
      "by these?\" enquired the stranger, grasping them quickly: \"Ah,<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum, I have heard all! Never mind,--continue!\" he resumed.<br>\r\n",
      "Presently there came forth a package addressed to \"Franconia<br>\r\n",
      "M'Carstrow,\" some of which the stranger recognised as superscribed<br>\r\n",
      "by his mother, others by Clotilda, for she could write when a slave.<br>\r\n",
      "Graspum would put this last aside; but in an angry tone did the<br>\r\n",
      "stranger demand it, as his passion had well nigh got the better of<br>\r\n",
      "his resolution. \"How the deep and damning infamy discovers itself!<br>\r\n",
      "Ah, Graspum, for the dross of this world hast thou betrayed the<br>\r\n",
      "innocent. Through thine emissaries has thus intercepted these<br>\r\n",
      "letters, and felt safe in thy guilt. And still you know not who I<br>\r\n",
      "am?\" Indeed, the man-seller was too much beside himself with terror<br>\r\n",
      "to have recognised even a near friend. \"My name is Lorenzo,--he who<br>\r\n",
      "more than twenty years ago you beguiled into crime. There is<br>\r\n",
      "concealed beneath those papers a bond that bears on its face the<br>\r\n",
      "secret of the many sorrows brought upon my family.\" \"Lorenzo!\"<br>\r\n",
      "interrupted Graspum, as he let fall a package of papers, and sat<br>\r\n",
      "aghast and trembling. \"Yes,\" replied the other, \"you cannot mistake<br>\r\n",
      "me, though time hath laid a heavy hand upon my brow. Now is your<br>\r\n",
      "infamy complete!\" Here the stranger drew forth the identical bond we<br>\r\n",
      "have described in the early part of our history, as being signed by<br>\r\n",
      "Marston, at his mansion, on the night previous to Lorenzo's<br>\r\n",
      "departure. Bidding the man-seller move not an inch, he spread the<br>\r\n",
      "document before him, and commanded him to read the contents. This he<br>\r\n",
      "had not resolution to do. \"Graspum!\" spoke Lorenzo, his countenance<br>\r\n",
      "flushed in passion; \"you can see, if you cannot read; look ye upon<br>\r\n",
      "the words of that paper (here he traced the lines with the<br>\r\n",
      "forefinger of his right hand as he stood over the wretched<br>\r\n",
      "miscreant) and tell me if it be honourable to spare the life of one<br>\r\n",
      "who would commit so foul a deed. On the night you consummated my<br>\r\n",
      "shame, forced me to relieve you by procuring my uncle's signature to<br>\r\n",
      "a document not then filled up, or made complete, how little did I<br>\r\n",
      "conjecture the germs of villainy so deep in your heart as to betray<br>\r\n",
      "the confidence I reposed in you. You, in your avarice, changed the<br>\r\n",
      "tenor of that instrument, made the amount more than double that<br>\r\n",
      "which I had injudiciously become indebted to you, and transcribed it<br>\r\n",
      "in the instrument, in legal phraseology, which you made a<br>\r\n",
      "death-warrant to my nearest and dearest relatives. Read it,<br>\r\n",
      "miscreant! read it! Read on it sixty-two thousand dollars, the cause<br>\r\n",
      "of your anxiety to hurry me out of the city into a foreign land. I<br>\r\n",
      "returned to seek a sister, to relieve my uncle, to live an<br>\r\n",
      "honourable man on that home so dear in my boyhood, so bright of that<br>\r\n",
      "which was pleasant in the past, to make glad the hearts of my aged<br>\r\n",
      "parents, and to receive the sweet forgiveness of those who honoured<br>\r\n",
      "me when fortune smiled; but you have left me none of these<br>\r\n",
      "boons-nay, you would have me again wander an outcast upon the<br>\r\n",
      "world!\" And now, as the miscreant fell tremblingly on his knees, and<br>\r\n",
      "beseeching that mercy which he had denied so many, Lorenzo's frenzy<br>\r\n",
      "surmounted all his resolution. With agitated hand he seized his<br>\r\n",
      "revolver, saying, \"I will go hence stained with a miscreant's<br>\r\n",
      "blood.\" Another moment, and the loud shriek of the man-seller echoed<br>\r\n",
      "forth, the sharp report of a pistol rung ominously through the<br>\r\n",
      "mansion; and quivering to the ground fell dead a wretch who had<br>\r\n",
      "tortured ten thousand souls, as Lorenzo disappeared and was seen no<br>\r\n",
      "more.<br>\r\n",
